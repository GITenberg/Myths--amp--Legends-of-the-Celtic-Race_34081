PREFACE
</head>

<p>
The Past may be forgotten, but it never dies.
The elements which in the most remote times
have entered into a nation's composition endure
through all its history, and help to mould that history,
and to stamp the character and genius of the people.
</p>

<p>
The examination, therefore, of these elements, and
the recognition, as far as possible, of the part they have
actually contributed to the warp and weft of a nation's
life, must be a matter of no small interest and importance
to those who realise that the present is the
child of the past, and the future of the present; who
will not regard themselves, their kinsfolk, and their
fellow-citizens as mere transitory phantoms, hurrying
from darkness into darkness, but who know that, in
them, a vast historic stream of national life is passing
from its distant and mysterious origin towards a future
which is largely conditioned by all the past wanderings
of that human stream, but which is also, in no small
degree, what they, by their courage, their patriotism,
their knowledge, and their understanding, choose to
make it.
</p>

<p>
The part played by the Celtic race as a formative
influence in the history, the literature, and the art of
the people inhabiting the British Islands&mdash;a people
which from that centre has spread its dominions over
so vast an area of the earth's surface&mdash;has been
unduly obscured in popular thought. For this the
current use of the term <q>Anglo-Saxon</q> applied to
the British people as a designation of race is largely
responsible. Historically the term is quite misleading.
There is nothing to justify this singling out of two
Low-German tribes when we wish to indicate the race-character
of the British people. The use of it leads to
such absurdities as that which the writer noticed not
<pb n='10' id='page10'/>
long ago, when the proposed elevation by the Pope of
an Irish bishop to a cardinalate was described in an
English newspaper as being prompted by the desire of
the head of the Catholic Church to pay a compliment
to <q>the Anglo-Saxon race.</q>
</p>

<p>
The true term for the population of these islands,
and for the typical and dominant part of the population
of North America, is not Anglo-Saxon, but Anglo-Celtic.
It is precisely in this blend of Germanic and
Celtic elements that the British people are unique&mdash;it
is precisely this blend which gives to this people the
fire, the <hi rend='italic'>élan</hi>, and in literature and art the sense of
style, colour, drama, which are not common growths
of German soil, while at the same time it gives the
deliberateness and depth, the reverence for ancient law
and custom, and the passion for personal freedom,
which are more or less strange to the Romance nations
of the South of Europe. May they never become
strange to the British Islands! Nor is the Celtic element
in these islands to be regarded as contributed
wholly, or even very predominantly, by the populations
of the so-called <q>Celtic Fringe.</q> It is now well
known to ethnologists that the Saxons did not by any
means exterminate the Celtic or Celticised populations
whom they found in possession of Great Britain.
Mr. E.W.B. Nicholson, librarian of the Bodleian,
writes in his important work <q>Keltic Researches</q> (1904):
</p>

<p>
<q>Names which have not been purposely invented to
describe race must never be taken as proof of race, but
only as proof of community of language, or community
of political organisation. We call a man who speaks
English, lives in England, and bears an obviously
English name (such as Freeman or Newton), an
Englishman. Yet from the statistics of <q>relative
<pb n='11' id='page11'/>
nigrescence</q> there is good reason to believe that
Lancashire, West Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire,
Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Rutland, Cambridgeshire,
Wiltshire, Somerset, and part of Sussex
are as Keltic as Perthshire and North Munster; that
Cheshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Monmouthshire,
Gloucestershire, Devon, Dorset, Northamptonshire,
Huntingdonshire, and Bedfordshire are more so&mdash;and
equal to North Wales and Leinster; while Buckinghamshire
and Hertfordshire exceed even this degree,
and are on a level with South Wales and Ulster.</q><note place='foot'><p>
In reference to the name <q>Freeman,</q> Mr. Nicholson adds:
<q>No one was more intensely <q>English</q> in his sympathies than the
great historian of that name, and probably no one would have more
strenuously resisted the suggestion that he might be of Welsh
descent; yet I have met his close physical counterpart in a Welsh
farmer (named Evans) living within a few minutes of Pwllheli.</q>
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
It is, then, for an Anglo-Celtic, not an <q>Anglo-Saxon,</q>
people that this account of the early history,
the religion, and the mythical and romantic literature
of the Celtic race is written. It is hoped that that
people will find in it things worthy to be remembered
as contributions to the general stock of European
culture, but worthy above all to be borne in mind by
those who have inherited more than have any other
living people of the blood, the instincts and the genius
of the Celt.

<head>CHAPTER I: THE CELTS IN ANCIENT HISTORY</head>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Earliest References</hi>
</p>

<p>
In the chronicles of the classical nations for about
five hundred years previous to the Christian era
there are frequent references to a people associated
with these nations, sometimes in peace, sometimes in
war, and evidently occupying a position of great
strength and influence in the Terra Incognita of Mid-Europe.
This people is called by the Greeks the
Hyperboreans or Celts, the latter term being first
found in the geographer Hecat&aelig;sus, about 500 B.C.<note place='foot'><p>
He speaks of <q>Nyrax, a Celtic city,</q> and <q>Massalia [Marseilles],
a city of Liguria in the land of the Celts</q> (<q>Fragmenta Hist.
Gr&aelig;c.</q>).
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Herodotus, about half a century later, speaks of the
Celts as dwelling <q>beyond the pillars of Hercules</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
in Spain&mdash;and also of the Danube as rising in their
country.
</p>

<p>
Aristotle knew that they dwelt <q>beyond Spain,</q>
that they had captured Rome, and that they set great
store by warlike power. References other than geographical
are occasionally met with even in early
writers. Hellanicus of Lesbos, an historian of the
fifth century B.C., describes the Celts as practising justice
and righteousness. Ephorus, about 350 B.C., has
three lines of verse about the Celts in which they are
described as using <q>the same customs as the Greeks</q>&mdash;whatever
that may mean&mdash;and being on the friendliest
terms with that people, who established guest friendships
among them. Plato, however, in the <q>Laws,</q>
classes the Celts among the races who are drunken and
combative, and much barbarity is attributed to them
on the occasion of their irruption into Greece and the
<pb n='18' id='page18'/>
sacking of Delphi in the year 273 B.C. Their attack
on Rome and the sacking of that city by them about a
century earlier is one of the landmarks of ancient history.
</p>

<p>
The history of this people during the time when
they were the dominant power in Mid-Europe has to
be divined or reconstructed from scattered references,
and from accounts of episodes in their dealings with
Greece and Rome, very much as the figure of a
prim&aelig;val monster is reconstructed by the zoologist
from a few fossilised bones. No chronicles of their
own have come down to us, no architectural remains
have survived; a few coins, and a few ornaments and
weapons in bronze decorated with enamel or with subtle
and beautiful designs in chased or repoussé work&mdash;these,
and the names which often cling in strangely
altered forms to the places where they dwelt, from the
Euxine to the British Islands, are well-nigh all the
visible traces which this once mighty power has left us
of its civilisation and dominion. Yet from these, and
from the accounts of classical writers, much can be
deduced with certainty, and much more can be conjectured
with a very fair measure of probability. The
great Celtic scholar whose loss we have recently had to
deplore, M. d'Arbois de Jubainville, has, on the available
data, drawn a convincing outline of Celtic history
for the period prior to their emergence into full historical
light with the conquests of C&aelig;sar,<note place='foot'><p>
In his <q>Premiers Habitants de l'Europe,</q> vol. ii.
</p></note> and it is this outline
of which the main features are reproduced here.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The True Celtic Race</hi>
</p>

<p>
To begin with, we must dismiss the idea that Celtica
was ever inhabited by a single pure and homogeneous
race. The true Celts, if we accept on this point the
carefully studied and elaborately argued conclusion of
<pb n='19' id='page19'/>
Dr. T. Rice Holmes,<note place='foot'><p>
<q>C&aelig;esar's Conquest of Gaul,</q> pp. 251-327.
</p></note> supported by the unanimous voice
of antiquity, were a tall, fair race, warlike and masterful,<note place='foot'><p>
The ancients were not very close observers of physical 
characteristics. They describe the Celts in almost exactly the same terms as
those which they apply to the Germanic races. Dr. Rice Holmes is
of opinion that the real difference, physically, lay in the fact that
the fairness of the Germans was blond, and that of the Celts red.
In an interesting passage of the work already quoted (p. 315) he
observes that, <q>Making every allowance for the admixture of other
blood, which must have considerably modified the type of the original
Celtic or Gallic invaders of these islands, we are struck by the fact
that among all our Celtic-speaking fellow subjects there are to be
found numerous specimens of a type which also exists in those parts
of Brittany which were colonised by British invaders, and in those
parts of Gaul in which the Gallic invaders appear to have settled
most thickly, as well as in Northern Italy, where the Celtic invaders
were once dominant; and also by the fact that this type, <hi rend='italic'>even among
the more blond representatives of it, is strikingly different, to the casual as
well as to the scientific observer, from that of the purest representatives of
the ancient Germans</hi>. The well-known picture of Sir David Wilkie,
<q>Reading of the Waterloo Gazette,</q> illustrates, as Daniel Wilson
remarked, the difference between the two types. Put a Perthshire
Highlander side by side with a Sussex farmer. Both will be fair; but
the red hair and beard of the Scot will be in marked contrast with
the fair hair of the Englishman, and their features will differ still
more markedly. I remember teeing two gamekeepers in a railway
carriage running from Inverness to Lairey. They were tall, athletic,
fair men, evidently belonging to the Scandinavian type, which, as
Dr. Beddoe says, is so common in the extreme north of Scotland;
but both in colouring and in general aspect they were utterly
different from the tall, fair Highlanders whom I had seen in Perthshire.
There was not a trace of red in their hair, their long beards
being absolutely yellow. The prevalence of red among the Celtic-speaking
people is, it seems to me, a most striking characteristic.
Not only do we find eleven men in every hundred whose hair is
absolutely red, but underlying the blacks and the dark browns the
lame tint is to be discovered.</q>
</p></note>
whose place of origin (as far as we can trace them) was
somewhere about the sources of the Danube, and who
spread their dominion both by conquest and by peaceful
<pb n='20' id='page20'/>
infiltration over Mid-Europe, Gaul, Spain, and the
British Islands. They did not exterminate the original
prehistoric inhabitants of these regions&mdash;pal&aelig;olithic
and neolithic races, dolmen-builders and workers in
bronze&mdash;but they imposed on them their language, their
arts, and their traditions, taking, no doubt, a good deal
from them in return, especially, as we shall see, in the
important matter of religion. Among these races the
true Celts formed an aristocratic and ruling caste. In
that capacity they stood, alike in Gaul, in Spain, in
Britain, and in Ireland, in the forefront or armed
opposition to foreign invasion. They bore the worst
brunt of war, of confiscations, and of banishment.
They never lacked valour, but they were not strong
enough or united enough to prevail, and they perished
in far greater proportion than the earlier populations
whom they had themselves subjugated. But they
disappeared also by mingling their blood with these
inhabitants, whom they impregnated with many of their
own noble and virile qualities. Hence it comes that
the characteristics of the peoples called Celtic in the
present day, and who carry on the Celtic tradition and
language, are in some respects so different from those
of the Celts of classical history and the Celts who produced
the literature and art of ancient Ireland, and in
others so strikingly similar. To take a physical characteristic
alone, the more Celtic districts of the British
Islands are at present marked by darkness of complexion,
hair, &amp;c. They are not very dark, but they
are darker than the rest of the kingdom.<note place='foot'><p>
See the map of comparative nigrescence given in Ripley's <q>Races
of Europe,</q> p. 318. In France, however, the Bretons are not a
dark race relatively to the rest of the population. They are composed
partly of the ancient Gallic peoples and partly of settlers from
Wales who were driven out by the Saxon invasion.
</p></note> But the
<pb n='21' id='page21'/>
true Celts were certainly fair. Even the Irish Celts of
the twelfth century are described by Giraldus Cambrensis
as a fair race.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Golden Age of the Celts</hi>
</p>

<p>
But we are anticipating, and must return to the period
of the origins of Celtic history. As astronomers have
discerned the existence of an unknown planet by the
perturbations which it has caused in the courses of
those already under direct observation, so we can discern
in the fifth and fourth centuries before Christ
the presence of a great power and of mighty movements
going on behind a veil which will never be
lifted now. This was the Golden Age of Celtdom in
Continental Europe. During this period the Celts
waged three great and successful wars, which had
no little influence on the course of South European
history. About 500 B.C. they conquered Spain from
the Carthaginians. A century later we find them
engaged in the conquest of Northern Italy from the
Etruscans. They settled in large numbers in the
territory afterwards known as Cisalpine Gaul, where
many names, such as <foreign rend='italic'>Mediolanum</foreign> (Milan), <foreign rend='italic'>Addua</foreign>
(Adda), <foreign rend='italic'>Viro-dunum</foreign> (Verduno), and perhaps <foreign rend='italic'>Cremona</foreign>
(<foreign rend='italic'>creamh</foreign>, garlic),<note place='foot'><p>
See for these names Holder's <q>Altceltischer Sprachschatz.</q>
</p></note> testify still to their occupation. They
left a greater memorial in the chief of Latin poets,
whose name, Vergil, appears to bear evidence of his
Celtic ancestry.<note place='foot'><p>
Vergil might possibly mean <q>the very-bright</q> or illustrious
one, a natural form for a proper name. <foreign rend='italic'>Ver</foreign> in Gallic names
(Vercingetorix, Vercassivellasimus, &amp;c.) is often an intensive prefix,
like the modern Irish <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>fior</foreign>. The name of the village where Vergil
was born, Andes (now Pietola), is Celtic. His love of nature, his
mysticism, and his strong feeling for a certain decorative quality
in language and rhythm are markedly Celtic qualities. Tennyson's
phrases for him, <q>landscape-lover, lord of language,</q> are suggestive
in this connexion.
</p></note> Towards the end of the fourth
<pb n='22' id='page22'/>
century they overran Pannonia, conquering the Illyrians.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Alliances with the Greeks</hi>
</p>

<p>
All these wars were undertaken in alliance with the
Greeks, with whom the Celts were at this period on
the friendliest terms. By the war with the Carthaginians
the monopoly held by that people of the trade
in tin with Britain and in silver with the miners of
Spain was broken down, and the overland route across
France to Britain, for the sake of which the Phoc&aelig;ans
had in 600 B.C. created the port of Marseilles, was
definitely secured to Greek trade. Greeks and Celts
were at this period allied against Phœnicians and
Persians. The defeat of Hamilcar by Gelon at
Himera, in Sicily, took place in the same year as that
of Xerxes at Salamis. The Carthaginian army in that
expedition was made up of mercenaries from half a
dozen different nations, but not a Celt is found in the
Carthaginian ranks, and Celtic hostility must have
counted for much in preventing the Carthaginians from
lending help to the Persians for the overthrow of
their common enemy. These facts show that Celtica
played no small part in preserving the Greek type of
civilisation from being overwhelmed by the despotisms
of the East, and thus in keeping alive in Europe the
priceless seed of freedom and humane culture.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Alexander the Great</hi>
</p>

<p>
When the counter-movement of Hellas against the
East began under Alexander the Great we find the
Celts again appearing as a factor of importance.
</p>


<pb n='23' id='page23'/>

<p>
In the fourth century Macedon was attacked and
almost obliterated by Thracian and Illyrian hordes.
King Amyntas II. was defeated and driven into exile.
His son Perdiccas II. was killed in battle. When
Philip, a younger brother of Perdiccas, came to the
obscure and tottering throne which he and his successors
were to make the seat of a great empire he
was powerfully aided in making head against the
Illyrians by the conquests of the Celts in the valleys
of the Danube and the Po. The alliance was continued,
and rendered, perhaps, more formal in the days
of Alexander. When about to undertake his conquest
of Asia (334 B.C.) Alexander first made a compact with
the Celts <q>who dwelt by the Ionian Gulf</q> in order
to secure his Greek dominions from attack during his
absence. The episode is related by Ptolemy Soter in
his history of the wars of Alexander.<note place='foot'><p>
Ptolemy, a friend, and probably, indeed, half-brother, of
Alexander, was doubtless present when this incident took place.
His work has not survived, but is quoted by Arrian and other
historians.
</p></note> It has a vividness
which stamps it as a bit of authentic history, and
another singular testimony to the truth of the narrative
has been brought to light by de Jubainville. As
the Celtic envoys, who are described as men of haughty
bearing and great stature, their mission concluded,
were drinking with the king, he asked them, it is said,
what was the thing they, the Celts, most feared.
The envoys replied: <q>We fear no man: there is
but one thing that we fear, namely, that the sky should
fall on us; but we regard nothing so much as the
friendship of a man such as thou.</q> Alexander bade
them farewell, and, turning to his nobles, whispered:
<q>What a vainglorious people are these Celts!</q>
Yet the answer, for all its Celtic bravura and flourish,
<pb n='24' id='page24'/>
was not without both dignity and courtesy. The
reference to the falling of the sky seems to give a
glimpse of some primitive belief or myth of which it
is no longer possible to discover the meaning.<note place='foot'><p>
One is reminded of the folk-tale about Henny Penny, who went
to tell the king that the sky was falling.

national oath by which the Celts bound themselves

remarkable. <q>If we observe not this engagement,</q>

</p></note> This survival of a peculiar
oath-formula for more than a thousand years, and its
reappearance, after being first heard of among the
Celts of Mid-Europe, in a mythical romance of Ireland,
is certainly most curious, and, with other facts
which we shall note hereafter, speaks strongly for the
community and persistence of Celtic culture.<note place='foot'><p>
It is also a testimony to the close accuracy of the narrative of

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Sack of Rome</hi>
</p>

<p>
We have mentioned two of the great wars of the
Continental Celts; we come now to the third, that with
the Etruscans, which ultimately brought them into
conflict with the greatest power of pagan Europe, and
led to their proudest feat of arms, the sack of Rome.
About the year 400 B.C. the Celtic Empire seems to
have reached the height of its power. Under a king
named by Livy Ambicatus, who was probably the head
of a dominant tribe in a military confederacy, like the
German Emperor in the present day, the Celts seem to
have been welded into a considerable degree of political
unity, and to have followed a consistent policy. Attracted
by the rich land of Northern Italy, they poured
down through the passes of the Alps, and after hard
fighting with the Etruscan inhabitants they maintained
their ground there. At this time the Romans were
pressing on the Etruscans from below, and Roman and
Celt were acting in definite concert and alliance. But
the Romans, despising perhaps the Northern barbarian
warriors, had the rashness to play them false at the
siege of Clusium, 391 B.C., a place which the Romans
regarded as one of the bulwarks of Latium against the
North. The Celts recognised Romans who had come
to them in the sacred character of ambassadors fighting
in the ranks of the enemy. The events which followed
are, as they have come down to us, much mingled
with legend, but there are certain touches of dramatic
vividness in which the true character of the Celts
appears distinctly recognisable. They applied, we are
told, to Rome for satisfaction for the treachery of the
envoys, who were three sons of Fabius Ambustus, the
chief pontiff. The Romans refused to listen to the
claim, and elected the Fabii military tribunes for the
<pb n='26' id='page26'/>
ensuing year. Then the Celts abandoned the siege of
Clusium and marched straight on Rome. The army
showed perfect discipline. There was no indiscriminate
plundering and devastation, no city or fortress was
assailed. <q>We are bound for Rome</q> was their cry to
the guards upon the walls of the provincial towns, who
watched the host in wonder and fear as it rolled steadily
to the south. At last they reached the river Allia, a
few miles from Rome, where the whole available force
of the city was ranged to meet them. The battle took
place on July 18, 390, that ill-omened <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>dies Alliensis</foreign>
which long perpetuated in the Roman calendar the
memory of the deepest shame the republic had ever
known. The Celts turned the flank of the Roman
army, and annihilated it in one tremendous charge.
Three days later they were in Rome, and for nearly a
year they remained masters of the city, or of its ruins,
till a great fine had been exacted and full vengeance
taken for the perfidy at Clusium. For nearly a century
after the treaty thus concluded there was peace
between the Celts and the Romans, and the breaking
of that peace when certain Celtic tribes allied themselves
with their old enemy, the Etruscans, in the third
Samnite war was coincident with the breaking up of
the Celtic Empire.<note place='foot'><p>
Roman history tells of various conflicts with the Celts during
this period, but de Jubainville has shown that these narratives are
almost entirely mythical. See <q>Premiers Habitants,</q> ii. 318-323.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Two questions must now be considered before
we can leave the historical part of this Introduction.
First of all, what are the evidences for the widespread
diffusion of Celtic power in Mid-Europe during
this period? Secondly, where were the Germanic
peoples, and what was their position in regard to the Celts?
</p>

<pb n='27' id='page27'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Celtic Place-names in Europe</hi>
</p>

<p>
To answer these questions fully would take us (for
the purposes of this volume) too deeply into philological
discussions, which only the Celtic scholar can
fully appreciate. The evidence will be found fully set
forth in de Jubainville's work, already frequently referred
to. The study of European place-names forms
the basis of the argument. Take the Celtic name <foreign rend='italic'>Noviomagus</foreign>
composed of two Celtic words, the adjective
meaning new, and <foreign rend='italic'>magos</foreign> (Irish <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>magh</foreign>) a field or plain.<note place='foot'><p>
<hi rend='italic'>E.g.,</hi> Moymell (<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>magh-meala</foreign>), the Plain of Honey, a Gaelic name
for Fairyland, and many place-names.
</p></note>
There were nine places of this name known in antiquity.
Six were in France, among them the places now called
Noyon, in Oise, Nijon, in Vosges, Nyons, in Drôme.
Three outside of France were Nimègue, in Belgium,
Neumagen, in the Rhineland, and one at Speyer, in the
Palatinate.
</p>

<p>
The word <foreign rend='italic'>dunum</foreign>, so often traceable in Gaelic place-names
in the present day (Dundalk, Dunrobin, &amp;c.),
and meaning fortress or castle, is another typically
Celtic element in European place-names. It occurred
very frequently in France&mdash;<foreign rend='italic'>e.g., Lug-dunum</foreign> (Lyons),
<foreign rend='italic'>Viro-dunum</foreign> (Verdun). It is also found in Switzerland&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>e.g., 
Minno-dunum</hi> (Moudon), <foreign rend='italic'>Eburo-dunum</foreign> (Yverdon)&mdash;and
in the Netherlands, where the famous city
of Leyden goes back to a Celtic <foreign rend='italic'>Lug-dunum.</foreign> In Great
Britain the Celtic term was often changed by simple
translation into <foreign rend='italic'>castra</foreign>; thus <foreign rend='italic'>Camulo-dunum</foreign> became
Colchester, <foreign rend='italic'>Brano-dunum</foreign> Brancaster. In Spain and
Portugal eight names terminating in <foreign rend='italic'>dunum</foreign> are mentioned
by classical writers. In Germany the modern
names Kempton, Karnberg, Liegnitz, go back respectively
to the Celtic forms <foreign rend='italic'>Cambo-dunum, Carro-aunum,</foreign>
<pb n='28' id='page28'/>
<foreign rend='italic'>Lugi-dunum</foreign>, and we find a <foreign rend='italic'>Singi-dunum,</foreign> now
Belgrade, in Servia, a <foreign rend='italic'>Novi-dunum</foreign>, now Isaktscha, in
Roumania, a <foreign rend='italic'>Carro-dunum</foreign> in South Russia, near the
Dniester, and another in Croatia, now Pitsmeza. <foreign rend='italic'>Sego-dunum</foreign>,
now Rodez, in France, turns up also in Bavaria
(Wurzburg), and in England (<foreign rend='italic'>Sege-dunum,</foreign> now Wallsend,
in Northumberland), and the first term, <foreign rend='italic'>sego</foreign>, is
traceable in Segorbe (<foreign rend='italic'>Sego-briga</foreign>) in Spain. <foreign rend='italic'>Briga</foreign> is a
Celtic word, the origin of the German <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>burg</foreign>, and equivalent
in meaning to <foreign rend='italic'>dunum</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
One more example: the word <foreign rend='italic'>magos</foreign>, a plain, which
is very frequent as an element of Irish place-names, is
found abundantly in France, and outside of France, in
countries no longer Celtic, it appears in Switzerland
(<foreign rend='italic'>Uro-magus</foreign> now Promasens), in the Rhineland (<foreign rend='italic'>Broco-magus</foreign>,
Brumath), in the Netherlands, as already noted
(Nimègue), in Lombardy several times, and in Austria.
</p>

<p>
The examples given are by no means exhaustive, but
they serve to indicate the wide diffusion of the Celts in
Europe and their identity of language over their vast
territory.<note place='foot'><p>

<q>Premiers Habitants,</q> ii. 255 <hi rend='italic'>sqq.</hi>

</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Early Celtic Art</hi>
</p>

<p>
The relics of ancient Celtic art-work tell the same
story. In the year 1846 a great pre-Roman necropolis
was discovered at Hallstatt, near Salzburg, in Austria.
It contains relics believed by Dr. Arthur Evans to date
from about 750 to 400 B.C. These relics betoken in
some cases a high standard of civilisation and considerable
commerce. Amber from the Baltic is there,
Phoenician glass, and gold-leaf of Oriental workmanship.
Iron swords are found whose hilts and sheaths are
richly decorated with gold, ivory, and amber.
</p>

<pb n='29' id='page29'/>

<p>
The Celtic culture illustrated by the remains at
Hallstatt developed later into what is called the La Tène
culture. La Tène was a settlement at the north-eastern
end of the Lake of Neuchâtel, and many objects of great
interest have been found there since the site was first
explored in 1858. These antiquities represent, according
to Dr. Evans, the culminating period of Gaulish
civilisation, and date from round about the third century
B.C. The type of art here found must be judged in the
light of an observation recently made by Mr. Romilly
Allen in his <q>Celtic Art</q> (p. 13):
</p>

<p>
<q>The great difficulty in understanding the evolution
of Celtic art lies in the fact that although the Celts
never seem to have invented any new ideas, they <corr sic='professed'>possessed</corr>
an extraordinary aptitude for
picking up ideas from the different peoples with whom
war or commerce brought them into contact. And
once the Celt had borrowed an idea from his neighbours
he was able to give it such a strong Celtic tinge that it
soon became something so different from what it was
originally as to be almost unrecognisable.</q>
</p>

<p>
Now what the Celt borrowed in the art-culture
which on the Continent culminated in the La Tène
relics were certain originally naturalistic motives for
Greek ornaments, notably the palmette and the meander
motives. But it was characteristic of the Celt that he
avoided in his art all imitation of, or even approximation
to, the natural forms of the plant and animal world.
He reduced everything to pure decoration. What he
enjoyed in decoration was the alternation of long
sweeping curves and undulations with the concentrated
energy of close-set spirals or bosses, and with these
simple elements and with the suggestion of a few
motives derived from Greek art he elaborated a most
<pb n='30' id='page30'/>
beautiful, subtle, and varied system of decoration, applied
to weapons, ornaments, and to toilet and household
appliances of all kinds, in gold, bronze, wood, and stone,
and possibly, if we had the means of judging, to textile
fabrics also. One beautiful feature in the decoration of
metal-work seems to have entirely originated in Celtica.
Enamelling was unknown to the classical nations till
they learned from the Celts. So late as the third
century A.D. it was still strange to the classical world,
as we learn from the reference of Philostratus:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>They say that the barbarians who live in the ocean
[Britons] pour these colours upon heated brass, and
that they adhere, become hard as stone, and preserve
the designs that are made upon them.</q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
Dr. J. Anderson writes in the <q>Proceedings of the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</q>:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>The Gauls as well as the Britons&mdash;of the same
Celtic stock&mdash;practised enamel-working before the
Roman conquest. The enamel workshops of Bibracte,
with their furnaces, crucibles, moulds, polishing-stones,
and with the crude enamels in their various stages of
preparation, have been recently excavated from the
ruins of the city destroyed by Caesar and his legions.
But the Bibracte enamels are the work of mere dabblers
in the art, compared with the British examples. The
home of the art was Britain, and the style of the pattern,
as well as the association in which the objects decorated
with it were found, demonstrated with certainty that it
had reached its highest stage of indigenous development
before it came in contact with the Roman culture.</q><note place='foot'><p>
Quoted by Mr. Romilly Allen in <q>Celtic Art,</q> p. 136.
</p></note>
</q>
</p>

<p>
The National Museum in Dublin contains many
superb examples of Irish decorative art in gold, bronze,
<pb n='31' id='page31'/>
and enamels, and the <q>strong Celtic tinge</q> of which
Mr. Romilly Allen speaks is as clearly observable there
as in the relics of Hallstatt or La Tène.
</p>

<p>
Everything, then, speaks of a community of culture,
an identity of race-character, existing over the vast
territory known to the ancient world as <q>Celtica.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Celts and Germans</hi>
</p>

<p>
But, as we have said before, this territory was by no
means inhabited by the Celt alone. In particular we have
to ask, who and where were the Germans, the Teuto-Gothic
tribes, who eventually took the place of the Celts
as the great Northern menace to classical civilisation?
</p>

<p>
They are mentioned by Pytheas, the eminent Greek
traveller and geographer, about 300 B.C., but they play
no part in history till, under the name of Cimbri and
Teutones, they descended on Italy to be vanquished by
Marius at the close of the second century. The ancient
Greek geographers prior to Pytheas know nothing of
them, and assign all the territories now known as
Germanic to various Celtic tribes.
</p>

<p>
The explanation given by de Jubainville, and based
by him on various philological considerations, is that
the Germans were a subject people, comparable to those
<q>un-free tribes</q> who existed in Gaul and in ancient
Ireland. They lived under the Celtic dominion, and
had no independent political existence. De Jubainville
finds that all the words connected with law and
government and war which are common both to the
Celtic and Teutonic languages were borrowed by the
latter from the former. Chief among them are the
words represented by the modern German <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Reich</foreign>,
empire, <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Amt</foreign>, office, and the Gothic <hi rend='italic'>reiks</hi>, a king, all
of which are of unquestioned Celtic origin. De
Jubainville also numbers among loan words from Celtic
<pb n='32' id='page32'/>
the words <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Bann</foreign>, an order; <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Frei</foreign>, free; <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Geisel</foreign>, a hostage;
<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Erbe</foreign>, an inheritance; <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Werth</foreign>, value; <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Weih</foreign>, 
sacred; <foreign rend='italic'>Magus</foreign>, a slave (Gothic); <foreign rend='italic'>Wini</foreign>, a wife (Old
High German); <hi rend='italic'>Skalks, Schalk</hi>, a slave (Gothic);
<foreign rend='italic'>Hathu</foreign>, battle (Old German); <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Helith, Held</foreign>, a hero,
from the same root as the word Celt; <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Heer</foreign>, an army
(Celtic <foreign rend='italic'>choris</foreign>); <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Sieg</foreign>, victory; <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Beute</foreign>, booty; <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Burg</foreign>, a
castle; and many others.
</p>

<p>
The etymological history of some of these words is
interesting. <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Amt</foreign>, for instance, that word of so much
significance in modern German administration, goes back
to an ancient Celtic <foreign rend='italic'>ambhactos</foreign>, which is compounded of
the words <foreign rend='italic'>ambi</foreign>, about, and <foreign rend='italic'>actos</foreign>, a past participle derived
from the Celtic root <foreign rend='italic'>AG</foreign>, meaning to act. Now <foreign rend='italic'>ambi</foreign>
descends from the primitive Indo-European <hi rend='italic'>mbhi</hi>, where
the initial <hi rend='italic'>m</hi> is a kind of vowel, afterwards represented
in Sanscrit by <hi rend='italic'>a</hi>. This <hi rend='italic'>m</hi> vowel became <hi rend='italic'>n</hi> in those
Germanic words which derive directly from the primitive
Indo-European tongue. But the word which is
now represented by <hi rend='italic'>amt</hi> appears in its earliest Germanic
form as <foreign rend='italic'>ambaht</foreign>, thus making plain its descent from the
Celtic <foreign rend='italic'>ambhactos</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
Again, the word <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>frei</foreign> is found in its earliest Germanic
form as <foreign rend='italic'>frijo-s,</foreign> which comes from the primitive Indo-European
<foreign rend='italic'>prijo-s</foreign>. The word here does not, however,
mean free; it means beloved (Sanscrit <foreign lang='sa' rend='italic'>priya-s</foreign>). In
the Celtic language, however, we find <foreign lang='cel' rend='italic'>prijos</foreign> dropping
its initial <hi rend='italic'>p</hi>&mdash;a difficulty in pronouncing this letter was
a marked feature in ancient Celtic; it changed <hi rend='italic'>j</hi>, according
to a regular rule, into <hi rend='italic'>dd</hi>, and appears in modern
Welsh as <foreign lang='cy' rend='italic'>rhydd</foreign>=free. The Indo-European meaning
persists in the Germanic languages in the name of the
love-goddess, <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Freia</foreign>, and in the word <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Freund</foreign>, friend,
<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Friede</foreign>, peace. The sense borne by the word in the
sphere of civil right is traceable to a Celtic origin,
<pb n='33' id='page33'/>
and in that sense appears to have been a loan from Celtic.
</p>

<p>
The German <foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Beute</foreign>, booty, plunder, has had an
instructive history. There was a Gaulish word <foreign lang='cel' rend='italic'>bodi</foreign>
found in compounds such as the place-name Segobodium
(Seveux), and various personal and tribal names,
including Boudicca, better known to us as the <q>British
warrior queen,</q> Boadicea. This word meant anciently
<q>victory.</q> But the fruits of victory are spoil, and
in this material sense the word was adopted in German,
in French (<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>butin</foreign>) in Norse (<foreign lang='non' rend='italic'>byte</foreign>), and the Welsh
(<foreign lang='cy' rend='italic'>budd</foreign>). On the other hand, the word preserved its
elevated significance in Irish. In the Irish translation
of Chronicles xxix. 11, where the Vulgate original has
<q><foreign lang='la'>Tua est, Domine, magnificentia et potentia et gloria et
victoria,</foreign></q> the word <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>victoria</foreign> is rendered by the Irish <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>búaidh</foreign>,
and, as de Jubainville remarks, <q><foreign lang='fr'>ce n'est pas de butin
qu'il s'agit.</foreign></q> He goes on to say: <q><foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Búaidh</foreign> has preserved
in Irish, thanks to a vigorous and persistent
literary culture, the high meaning which it bore in the
tongue of the Gaulish aristocracy. The material sense
of the word was alone perceived by the lower classes of
the population, and it is the tradition of this lower
class which has been preserved in the German, the
French, and the Cymric languages.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Premiers Habitants,</q> ii. 355, 356.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Two things, however, the Celts either could not or
would not impose on the subjugated German tribes&mdash;their
language and their religion. In these two great
factors of race-unity and pride lay the seeds of the
ultimate German uprising and overthrow of the Celtic
supremacy. The names of the German are different
from those of the Celtic deities, their funeral customs,
with which are associated the deepest religious conceptions
of primitive races, are different. The Celts, or
<pb n='34' id='page34'/>
at least the dominant section of them, buried their
dead, regarding the use of fire as a humiliation, to be
inflicted on criminals, or upon slaves or prisoners in
those terrible human sacrifices which are the greatest
stain on their native culture. The Germans, on the
other hand, burned their illustrious dead on pyres, like
the early Greeks&mdash;if a pyre could not be afforded for
the whole body, the noblest parts, such as the head
and arms, were burned and the rest buried.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Downfall of the Celtic Empire</hi>
</p>

<p>
What exactly took place at the time of the German
revolt we shall never know; certain it is, however,
that from about the year 300 B.C. onward the Celts
appear to have lost whatever political cohesion and
common purpose they had possessed. Rent asunder,
as it were, by the upthrust of some mighty subterranean
force, their tribes rolled down like lava-streams to the
south, east, and west of their original home. Some
found their way into Northern Greece, where they
committed the outrage which so scandalised their
former friends and allies in the sack of the shrine
of Delphi (273 B.C.). Others renewed, with worse
fortune, the old struggle with Rome, and perished
in vast numbers at Sentinum (295 B.C.) and Lake
Vadimo (283 B.C.). One detachment penetrated into
Asia Minor, and founded the Celtic State of Galatia,
where, as St. Jerome attests, a Celtic dialect was still
spoken in the fourth century A.D. Others enlisted as
mercenary troops with Carthage. A tumultuous war of
Celts against scattered German tribes, or against other
Celts who represented earlier waves of emigration and
conquest, went on all over Mid-Europe, Gaul, and
Britain. When this settled down Gaul and the British
Islands remained practically the sole relics of the Celtic
<pb n='35' id='page35'/>
empire, the only countries still under Celtic law and
leadership. By the commencement of the Christian era
Gaul and Britain had fallen under the yoke of Rome,
and their complete Romanisation was only a question of time.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Unique Historical Position of Ireland</hi>
</p>

<p>
Ireland alone was never even visited, much less
subjugated, by the Roman legionaries, and maintained
its independence against all comers nominally until
the close of the twelfth century, but for all practical
purposes a good three hundred years longer.
</p>

<p>
Ireland has therefore this unique feature of interest,
that it carried an indigenous Celtic civilisation, Celtic
institutions, art, and literature, and the oldest surviving
form of the Celtic language,<note place='foot' id='p35n1'><p>
Irish is probably an older form of Celtic speech than Welsh.
This is shown by many philological peculiarities of the Irish language,
of which one of the most interesting may here be briefly referred to.
The Goidelic or Gaelic Celts, who, according to the usual theory,
first colonised the British Islands, and who were forced by successive
waves of invasion by their Continental kindred to the extreme west,
had a peculiar dislike to the pronunciation of the letter <hi rend='italic'>p</hi>. Thus
the Indo-European particle <foreign rend='italic'>pare</foreign>, represented by Greek <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>παρά</foreign>, beside
or close to, becomes in early Celtic <foreign rend='italic'>are</foreign>, as in the name <foreign rend='italic'>Are-morici</foreign>
(the Armoricans, those who dwell <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>ar muir</foreign>, by the sea); <foreign rend='italic'>Are-dunum</foreign>
(Ardin, in France); <foreign rend='italic'>Are-cluta</foreign>, the place beside the Clota (Clyde), now
Dumbarton; <foreign rend='italic'>Are-taunon,</foreign> in Germany (near the Taunus Mountains),
&amp;c. When this letter was not simply dropped it was usually changed
into <hi rend='italic'>c (k, g)</hi>. But about the sixth century B.C. a remarkable change
passed over the language of the Continental Celts. They gained in
some unexplained way the faculty for pronouncing <hi rend='italic'>p</hi>, and even
substituted it for existing <hi rend='italic'>c</hi> sounds; thus the original <foreign rend='italic'>Cretanis</foreign> became
<foreign rend='italic'>Pretanis</foreign>, Britain, the numeral <foreign rend='italic'>qetuares</foreign> (four) became <foreign rend='italic'>petuares</foreign>,
and so forth. Celtic place-names in Spain show that this change
must have taken place before the Celtic conquest of that country,
500 B.C. Now a comparison of many Irish and Welsh words shows
distinctly this avoidance of <foreign rend='italic'>p</foreign> on the Irish side and lack of any objection
to it on the Welsh. The following are a few illustrations:

<p>
The conclusion that Irish must represent the older form of the
language seems obvious. It is remarkable that even to a comparatively
late date the Irish preserved their dislike to <hi rend='italic'>p</hi>. Thus they
turned the Latin <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>Pascha</foreign> (Easter) to <foreign rend='italic'>Casg; purpur</foreign>, purple, to <foreign rend='italic'>corcair,
pulsatio</foreign> (through French <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>pouls</foreign>) to <foreign rend='italic'>cuisle</foreign>. It must be noted, however,
that Nicholson in his <q>Keltic Researches</q> endeavours to show
that the so-called Indo-European <hi rend='italic'>p</hi>&mdash;that is, <hi rend='italic'>p</hi> standing alone and
uncombined with another consonant&mdash;was pronounced by the
Goidelic Celts at an early period. The subject can hardly be said to
be cleared up yet.

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Celtic Character</hi>
</p>

<p>
The moral no less than the physical characteristics
attributed by classical writers to the Celtic peoples
show a remarkable distinctness and consistency. Much
of what is said about them might, as we should expect,
be said of any primitive and unlettered people, but there
remains so much to differentiate them among the races
of mankind that if these ancient references to the Celts
could be read aloud, without mentioning the name of the
race to whom they referred, to any person acquainted
with it through modern history alone, he would, I think,
without hesitation, name the Celtic peoples as the subject
of the description which he had heard.
</p>

<p>
Some of these references have already been quoted,
and we need not repeat the evidence derived from
Plato, Ephorus, or Arrian. But an observation of
<pb n='37' id='page37'/>
M. Porcius Cato on the Gauls may be adduced. <q>There
are two things,</q> he says, <q>to which the Gauls are
devoted&mdash;the art of war and subtlety of speech</q> (<q><foreign lang='la'>rem
militarem et argute loqui</foreign></q>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>C&aelig;sar's Account</hi>
</p>

<p>
C&aelig;sar has given us a careful and critical account
of them as he knew them in Gaul. They were, he
says, eager for battle, but easily dashed by reverses.
They were extremely superstitious, submitting to their
Druids in all public and private affairs, and regarding
it as the worst of punishments to be excommunicated
and forbidden to approach thu ceremonies of religion:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>They who are thus interdicted [for refusing to
obey a Druidical sentence] are reckoned in the number
of the vile and wicked; all persons avoid and fly their
company and discourse, lest they should receive any
infection by contagion; they are not permitted to
commence a suit; neither is any post entrusted to
them.... The Druids are generally freed from
military service, nor do they pay taxes with the
rest.... Encouraged by such rewards, many of
their own accord come to their schools, and are sent
by their friends and relations. They are said there to
get by heart a great number of verses; some continue
twenty years in their education; neither is it held
lawful to commit these things [the Druidic doctrines]
to writing, though in almost all public transactions and
private accounts they use the Greek characters.</q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
The Gauls were eager for news, besieging merchants
and travellers for gossip,<note place='foot'><p>
The Irish, says Edmund Spenser, in his <q>View of the Present
State of Ireland,</q> <q>use commonyle to send up and down to know
newes, and yf any meet with another, his second woorde is, What newes?</q>
</p></note> easily influenced, sanguine,
<pb n='38' id='page38'/>
credulous, fond of change, and wavering in their
counsels. They were at the same time remarkably
acute and intelligent, very quick to seize upon and
to imitate any contrivance they found useful. Their
ingenuity in baffling the novel siege apparatus of the
Roman armies is specially noticed by C&aelig;sar. Of their
courage he speaks with great respect, attributing their
scorn of death, in some degree at least, to their firm
faith in the immortality of the soul.<note place='foot'><p>
Compare Spenser: <q>I have heard some greate warriors say, that
in all the services which they had seen abroad in forrayne countreys,
they never saw a more comely horseman than the Irish man, nor that
cometh on more bravely in his charge ... they are very valiante
and hardye, for the most part great endurours of cold, labour, hunger
and all hardiness, very active and stronge of hand, very swift of
foote, very vigilaunte and circumspect in theyr enterprises, very
present in perrils, very great scorners of death.</q>
</p></note> A people who
in earlier days had again and again annihilated Roman
armies, had sacked Rome, and who had more than
once placed C&aelig;sar himself in positions of the utmost
anxiety and peril, were evidently no weaklings, whatever
their religious beliefs or practices. C&aelig;sar is not
given to sentimental admiration of his foes, but one
episode at the siege of Avaricum moves him to
immortalise the valour of the defence. A wooden
structure or <hi rend='italic'>agger</hi> had been raised by the Romans
to overtop the walls, which had proved impregnable
to the assaults of the battering-ram. The Gauls
contrived to set this on fire. It was of the utmost
moment to prevent the besiegers from extinguishing
the flames, and a Gaul mounted a portion of the wall
above the <hi rend='italic'>agger</hi>, throwing down upon it balls of tallow
and pitch, which were handed up to him from within.
He was soon struck down by a missile from a Roman
catapult. Immediately another stepped over him as he
lay, and continued his comrade's task. He too fell,
<pb n='39' id='page39'/>
but a third instantly took his place, and a fourth; nor
was this post ever deserted until the legionaries at
last extinguished the flames and forced the defenders
back into the town, which was finally captured on the
following day.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Strabo on the Celts</hi>
</p>

<p>
The geographer and traveller Strabo, who died
24 A.D., and was therefore a little later than C&aelig;sar, has
much to tell us about the Celts. He notices that their
country (in this case Gaul) is thickly inhabited and well
tilled&mdash;there is no waste of natural resources. The
women are prolific, and notably good mothers. He
describes the men as warlike, passionate, disputatious,
easily provoked, but generous and unsuspicious, and
easily vanquished by stratagem. They showed themselves
eager for culture, and Greek letters and science
had spread rapidly among them from Massilia; public
education was established in their towns. They fought
better on horseback than on foot, and in Strabo's time
formed the flower of the Roman cavalry. They dwelt
in great houses made of arched timbers with walls of
wickerwork&mdash;no doubt plastered with clay and lime,
as in Ireland&mdash;and thickly thatched. Towns of much
importance were found in Gaul, and C&aelig;sar notes the
strength of their walls, built of stone and timber.
Both C&aelig;sar and Strabo agree that there was a very
sharp division between the nobles and priestly or
educated class on the one hand and the common
people on the other, the latter being kept in strict
subjection. The social division corresponds roughly,
no doubt, to the race distinction between the true
Celts and the aboriginal populations subdued by them.
While C&aelig;sar tells us that the Druids taught the immortality
of the soul, Strabo adds that they believed in
<pb n='40' id='page40'/>
the indestructibility, which implies in some sense the
divinity, of the material universe.
</p>

<p>
The Celtic warrior loved display. Everything that
gave brilliance and the sense of drama to life appealed
to him. His weapons were richly ornamented, his
horse-trappings were wrought in bronze and enamel, of
design as exquisite as any relic of Mycenean or Cretan
art, his raiment was embroidered with gold. The
scene of the surrender of Vercingetorix, when his
heroic struggle with Rome had come to an end on
the fall of Alesia, is worth recording as a typically
Celtic blend of chivalry and of what appeared to the
sober-minded Romans childish ostentation.<note place='foot'><p>
The scene of the surrender of Vercingetorix is not recounted by
C&aelig;sar, and rests mainly on the authority of Plutarch and of the
historian Florus, but it is accepted by scholars (Mommsen, Long, &amp;c.)
as historic.
</p></note> When
he saw that the cause was lost he summoned a tribal
council, and told the assembled chiefs, whom he had
led through a glorious though unsuccessful war, that
he was ready to sacrifice himself for his still faithful
followers&mdash;they might send his head to C&aelig;sar if they
liked, or he would voluntarily surrender himself for
the sake of getting easier terms for his countrymen.
The latter alternative was chosen. Vercingetorix then
armed himself with his most splendid weapons, decked
his horse with its richest trappings, and, after riding
thrice round the Roman camp, went before C&aelig;sar and
laid at his feet the sword which was the sole remaining
defence of Gallic independence. C&aelig;sar sent him to
Rome, where he lay in prison for six years, and was
finally put to death when C&aelig;sar celebrated his triumph.
</p>

<p>
But the Celtic love of splendour and of art were
mixed with much barbarism. Strabo tells us how the
warriors rode home from victory with the heads of
<pb n='41' id='page41'/>
fallen foemen dangling from their horses' necks, just as
in the Irish saga the Ulster hero, Cuchulain, is represented
as driving back to Emania from a foray into
Connacht with the heads of his enemies hanging from
his chariot-rim. Their domestic arrangements were
rude; they lay on the ground to sleep, sat on couches
of straw, and their women worked in the fields.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Polybius</hi>
</p>

<p>
A characteristic scene from the battle of Clastidium
(222 B.C.) is recorded by Polybius. The G&aelig;sati,<note place='foot'><p>
These were a tribe who took their name from the <hi rend='italic'>g&aelig;sum</hi>, a kind
of Celtic javelin, which was their principal weapon. The torque,
or twisted collar of gold, is introduced as a typical ornament in the
well-known statue of the dying Gaul, commonly called <q>The Dying
Gladiator.</q> Many examples are preserved in the National Museum
of Dublin.
</p></note> he
tells us, who were in the forefront of the Celtic
army, stripped naked for the fight, and the sight of
these warriors, with their great stature and their fair
skins, on which glittered the collars and bracelets of
gold so loved as an adornment by all the Celts, filled
the Roman legionaries with awe. Yet when the day
was over those golden ornaments went in cartloads to
deck the Capitol of Rome; and the final comment of
Polybius on the character of the Celts is that they, <q>I
say not usually, but always, in everything they attempt,
are driven headlong by their passions, and never submit
to the laws of reason.</q> As might be expected,
the chastity for which the Germans were noted was
never, until recent times, a Celtic characteristic.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Diodorus</hi>
</p>

<p>
Diodorus Siculus, a contemporary of Julius C&aelig;sar and
Augustus, who had travelled in Gaul, confirms in the
main the accounts of C&aelig;sar and Strabo, but adds some
<pb n='42' id='page42'/>
interesting details. He notes in particular the Gallic
love of gold. Even cuirasses were made of it. This
is also a very notable trait in Celtic Ireland, where an
astonishing number of prehistoric gold relics have been
found, while many more, now lost, are known to have
existed. The temples and sacred places, say Posidonius
and Diodorus, were full of unguarded offerings of
gold, which no one ever touched. He mentions the
great reverence paid to the bards, and, like Cato, notices
something peculiar about the kind of speech which
the educated Gauls cultivated: <q>they are not a talkative
people, and are fond of expressing themselves in
enigmas, so that the hearer has to divine the most part
of what they would say.</q> This exactly answers to the
literary language of ancient Ireland, which is curt and
allusive to a degree. The Druid was regarded as the
prescribed intermediary between God and man&mdash;no one
could perform a religious act without his assistance.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi>
</p>

<p>
Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote much later, in
the latter half of the fourth century A.D., had also visited
Gaul, which was then, of course, much Romanised.
He tells us, however, like former writers, of the great
stature, fairness, and arrogant bearing of the Gallic
warrior. He adds that the people, especially in
Aquitaine, were singularly clean and proper in their
persons&mdash;no one was to be seen in rags. The Gallic
woman he describes as very tall, blue-eyed, and singularly
beautiful; but a certain amount of awe is mingled
with his evident admiration, for he tells us that while
it was dangerous enough to get into a fight with a
Gallic man, your case was indeed desperate if his wife
with her <q>huge snowy arms,</q> which could strike like
catapults, came to his assistance. One is irresistibly
<pb n='43' id='page43'/>
reminded of the gallery of vigorous, independent,
fiery-hearted women, like Maeve, Grania, Findabair,
Deirdre, and the historic Boadicea, who figure in the
myths and in the history of the British Islands.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Rice Holmes on the Gauls</hi>
</p>

<p>
The following passage from Dr. Rice Holmes'
<q>C&aelig;sar's Conquest of Gaul</q> may be taken as an admirable
summary of the social physiognomy of that part
of Celtica a little before the time of the Christian era,
and it corresponds closely to all that is known of the
native Irish civilisation:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>The Gallic peoples had risen far above the condition
of savages; and the Celticans of the interior,
many of whom had already fallen under Roman
influence, had attained a certain degree of civilisation,
and even of luxury. Their trousers, from which the
province took its name of Gallia Bracata, and their
many-coloured tartan skirts and cloaks excited the
astonishment of their conquerors. The chiefs wore
rings and bracelets and necklaces of gold; and when
these tall, fair-haired warriors rode forth to battle, with
their helmets wrought in the shape of some fierce
beast's head, and surmounted by nodding plumes,
their chain armour, their long bucklers and their huge
clanking swords, they made a splendid show. Walled
towns or large villages, the strongholds of the various
tribes, were conspicuous on numerous hills. The
plains were dotted by scores of oper hamlets. The
houses, built of timber and wickerwork, were large
and well thatched. The fields in summer were yellow
with corn. Roads ran from town to town. Rude
bridges spanned the rivers; and barges laden with
merchandise floated along them. Ships clumsy indeed
<pb n='44' id='page44'/>
but larger than any that were seen on the Mediterranean,
braved the storms of the Bay of Biscay and carried
cargoes between the ports of Brittany and the coast of
Britain. Tolls were exacted on the goods which were
transported on the great waterways; and it was from
the farming of these dues that the nobles derived a
large part of their wealth. Every tribe had its coinage;
and the knowledge of writing in Greek and Roman
characters was not confined to the priests. The
Æduans were familiar with the plating of copper and
of tin. The miners of Aquitaine, of Auvergne, and of
the Berri were celebrated for their skill. Indeed, in
all that belonged to outward prosperity the peoples of
Gaul had made great strides since their kinsmen first
came into contact with Rome.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>C&aelig;sar's Conquest of Gaul,</q> pp. 10, 11. Let it be added
that the aristocratic Celts were, like the Teutons, dolichocephalic&mdash;that
is to say, they had heads long in proportion to their breadth.
This is proved by remains found in the basin of the Marne, which
was thickly populated by them. In one case the skeleton of the tall
Gallic warrior was found with his war-car, iron helmet, and sword,
now in the Music de St.-Germain. The inhabitants of the British
Islands are uniformly long-headed, the round-headed <q>Alpine</q> type
occurring very rarely. Those of modern France are round-headed. The
shape of the head, however, is now known to be by no means a constant
racial character. It alters rapidly in a new environment, as is shown by
measurements of the descendants of immigrants in America. See an
article on this subject by Professor Haddon in <q>Nature,</q> Nov. 3, 1910.
</p></note>
</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Weakness of the Celtic Policy</hi>
</p>

<p>
Yet this native Celtic civilisation, in many respects
so attractive and so promising, had evidently some
defect or disability which prevented the Celtic peoples
from holding their own either against the ancient
civilisation of the Gr&aelig;co-Roman world, or against the
rude young vigour of the Teutonic races. Let us
consider what this was.
</p>

<pb n='45' id='page45'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Classical State</hi>
</p>

<p>
At the root of the success of classical nations lay the
conception of the civic community, the <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>πόλις</foreign>, the <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>res
publica</foreign>, as a kind of divine entity, the foundation of
blessing to men, venerable for its age, yet renewed in
youth with every generation; a power which a man
might joyfully serve, knowing that even if not remembered
in its records his faithful service would
outlive his own petty life and go to exalt the life
of his motherland or city for all future time. In this
spirit Socrates, when urged to evade his death sentence
by taking the means of escape from prison which his
friends offered him, rebuked them for inciting him to
an impious violation of his country's laws. For a
man's country, he says, is more holy and venerable
than father or mother, and he must quietly obey the
laws, to which he has assented by living under them all
his life, or incur the just wrath of their great Brethren,
the Laws of the Underworld, before whom, in the
end, he must answer for his conduct on earth. In a
greater or less degree this exalted conception of the
State formed the practical religion of every man among
the classical nations of antiquity, and gave to the State
its cohesive power, its capability of endurance and of progress.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Teutonic Loyalty</hi>
</p>

<p>
With the Teuton the cohesive force was supplied
by another motive, one which was destined to mingle
with the civic motive and to form, in union with it&mdash;and
often in predominance over it&mdash;the main political
factor in the development of the European nations.
This was the sentiment of what the Germans called
<foreign lang='de' rend='italic'>Treue</foreign>, the personal fidelity to a chief, which in very
<pb n='46' id='page46'/>
early times extended itself to a royal dynasty, a
sentiment rooted profoundly in the Teutonic nature,
and one which has never been surpassed by any
other human impulse as the source of heroic self-sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Celtic Religion</hi>
</p>

<p>
No human influences are ever found pure and
unmixed. The sentiment of personal fidelity was not
unknown to the classical nations. The sentiment of
civic patriotism, though of slow growth among the
Teutonic races, did eventually establish itself there.
Neither sentiment was unknown to the Celt, but there
was another force which, in his case, overshadowed and
dwarfed them, and supplied what it could of the
political inspiration and unifying power which the
classical nations got from patriotism and the Teutons
from loyalty. This was Religion; or perhaps it
would be more accurate to say Sacerdotalism&mdash;religion
codified in dogma and administered by a priestly caste.
The Druids, as we have seen from C&aelig;sar, whose
observations are entirely confirmed by Strabo and by
references in Irish legends,<note place='foot'><p>
In the <q>Tain Bo Cuailgne,</q> for instance, the King of Ulster must
not speak to a messenger until the Druid, Cathbad, has questioned
him. One recalls the lines of Sir Samuel Ferguson in his Irish epic
poem, <q>Congal</q>:
</p>

<p rend='blockquote'>
<q>... For ever since the time
When Cathbad smothered Usnach's sons in that foul sea of slime
Raised by abominable spells at Creeveroe's bloody gate,
Do ruin and dishonour still on priest-led kings await.</q>
</p></note> were the really sovran
power in Celtica. All affairs, public and private, were
subject to their authority, and the penalties which
they could inflict for any assertion of lay independence,
though resting for their efficacy, like the medi&aelig;val interdicts
of the Catholic Church, on popular superstition
<pb n='47' id='page47'/>
alone, were enough to quell the proudest spirit. Here
lay the real weakness of the Celtic polity. There
is perhaps no law written more conspicuously in the
teachings of history than that nations who are ruled
by priests drawing their authority from supernatural
sanctions are, just in the measure that they are so ruled,
incapable of true national progress. The free, healthy
current of secular life and thought is, in the very nature
of things, incompatible with priestly rule. Be the creed
what it may, Druidism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, or
fetichism, a priestly caste claiming authority in temporal
affairs by virtue of extra-temporal sanctions is inevitably
the enemy of that spirit of criticism, of that influx of
new ideas, of that growth of secular thought, of human
and rational authority, which are the elementary conditions
of national development.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Cursing of Tara</hi>
</p>

<p>
A singular and very cogent illustration of this truth
can be drawn from the history of the early Celtic
world. In the sixth century A.D., a little over a
hundred years after the preaching of Christianity by
St. Patrick, a king named Dermot MacKerval<note place='foot'><p>
<title rend='italic'>Celtice</title>, Diarmuid mac Cearbhaill.
</p></note> ruled
in Ireland. He was the Ard Righ, or High King, of
that country, whose seat of government was at Tara, in
Meath, and whose office, with its nominal and legal
superiority to the five provincial kings, represented the
impulse which was moving the Irish people towards a
true national unity. The first condition of such a unity
was evidently the establishment of an effective central
authority. Such an authority, as we have said, the
High King, in theory, represented. Now it happened
that one of his officers was murdered in the discharge
of his duty by a chief named Hugh Guairy. Guairy
<pb n='48' id='page48'/>
was the brother of a bishop who was related by
fosterage to St. Ruadan of Lorrha, and when King
Dermot sent to arrest the murderer these clergy found
him a hiding-place. Dermot, however, caused a search
to be made, haled him forth from under the roof of
St. Ruadan, and brought him to Tara for trial. Immediately
the ecclesiastics of Ireland made common
cause against the lay ruler who had dared to execute
justice on a criminal under clerical protection. They
assembled at Tara, fasted against the king,<note place='foot' id='p48_n1'><p>
It was the practice, known in India also, for a person who was
wronged by a superior, or thought himself so, to sit before the doorstep
of the denier of justice and fast until right was done him. In
Ireland a magical power was attributed to the ceremony, the effect
of which would be averted by the other person fasting as well.
</p></note> and laid
their solemn malediction upon him and the seat of
his government. Then the chronicler tells us that
Dermot's wife had a prophetic dream:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>Upon Tara's green was a vast and wide-foliaged
tree, and eleven slaves hewing at it; but every chip
that they knocked from it would return into its place
again and there adhere instantly, till at last there came
one man that dealt the tree but a stroke, and with that
single cut laid it low.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Silva Gadelica,</q> by S.H. O'Grady, p. 73.
</p></note>
</q>
</p>

<p>
The fair tree was the Irish monarchy, the twelve
hewers were the twelve Saints or Apostles of Ireland,
and the one who laid it low was St. Ruadan. The plea
of the king for his country, whose fate he saw to be
hanging in the balance, is recorded with moving force
and insight by the Irish chronicler:<note place='foot'><p>
The authority here quoted is a narrative contained in a fifteenth-century
vellum manuscript found in Lismore Castle in 1814, and
translated by S.H. O'Grady in his <q>Silva Gadelica.</q> The narrative
is attributed to an officer of Dermot's court.
</p></note>
</p>

<pb n='49' id='page49'/>
<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q><q>Alas,</q> he said, <q>for the iniquitous contest that ye
have waged against me; seeing that it is Ireland's
good that I pursue, and to preserve her discipline and
royal right; but 'tis Ireland's unpeace and murderousness
that ye endeavour after.</q></q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
But Ruadan said, <q>Desolate be Tara for ever and
ever</q>; and the popular awe of the ecclesiastical malediction
prevailed. The criminal was surrendered, Tara
was abandoned, and, except for a brief space when a
strong usurper, Brian Boru, fought his way to power,
Ireland knew no effective secular government till it
was imposed upon her by a conqueror. The last
words of the historical tract from which we quote are
Dermot's cry of despair:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>Woe to him that with the clergy of the churches
battle joins.</q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
This remarkable incident has been described at some
length because it is typical of a factor whose profound
influence in moulding the history of the Celtic
peoples we can trace through a succession of critical
events from the time of Julius Caesar to the present
day. How and whence it arose we shall consider later;
here it is enough to call attention to it. It is a factor
which forbade the national development of the Celts,
in the sense in which we can speak of that of the
classical or the Teutonic peoples.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>What Europe Owes to the Celt</hi>
</p>

<p>
Yet to suppose that on this account the Celt was not a
force of any real consequence in Europe would be altogether
a mistake. His contribution to the culture of
the Western world was a very notable one. For some
four centuries&mdash;about A.D. 500 to 900&mdash;Ireland was
<pb n='50' id='page50'/>
the refuge of learning and the source of literary and
philosophic culture for half Europe. The verse-forms
of Celtic poetry have probably played the main part in
determining the structure of all modern verse. The
myths and legends of the Gaelic and Cymric peoples
kindled the imagination of a host of Continental poets.
True, the Celt did not himself create any great architectural
work of literature, just as he did not create a
stable or imposing national polity. His thinking and
feeling were essentially lyrical and concrete. Each
object or aspect of life impressed him vividly and
stirred him profoundly; he was sensitive, impressionable
to the last degree, but did not see things in their
larger and more far-reaching relations. He had little
gift for the establishment or institutions, for the service
of principles; but he was, and is, an indispensable and
never-failing assertor of humanity as against the
tyranny of principles, the coldness and barrenness of
institutions. The institutions of royalty and of civic
patriotism are both very capable of being fossilised
into barren formulae, and thus of fettering instead of
inspiring the soul. But the Celt has always been a
rebel against anything that has not in it the breath of
life, against any unspiritual and purely external form
of domination. It is too true that he has been over-eager
to enjoy the fine fruits of life without the long
and patient preparation for the harvest, but he has
done and will still do infinite service to the modern
world in insisting that the true fruit of life is a
spiritual reality, never without pain and loss to be
obscured or forgotten amid the vast mechanism of a
material civilisation.

CHAPTER II: THE RELIGION OF THE CELTS
</head>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Ireland and the Celtic Religion</hi>
</p>

<p>
We have said that the Irish among the Celtic
peoples possess the unique interest of having
carried into the light of modern historical research
many of the features of a native Celtic civilisation.
There is, however, one thing which they did not carry
across the gulf which divides us from the ancient world&mdash;and 
this was their religion.
</p>

<p>
It was not merely that they changed it; they left it
behind them so entirely that all record of it is lost.
St. Patrick, himself a Celt, who apostolised Ireland
during the fifth century, has left us an autobiographical
narrative of his mission, a document of intense interest,
and the earliest extant record of British Christianity;
but in it he tells us nothing of the doctrines he came to
supplant. We learn far more of Celtic religious beliefs
from Julius C&aelig;sar, who approached them from quite
another side. The copious legendary literature which
took its present form in Ireland between the seventh
and the twelfth centuries, though often manifestly
going back to pre-Christian sources, shows us, beyond
a belief in magic and a devotion to certain ceremonial
or chivalric observances, practically nothing resembling
a religious or even an ethical system. We know that
certain chiefs and bards offered a long resistance to
the new faith, and that this resistance came to the
arbitrament of battle at Moyrath in the sixth century,
but no echo of any intellectual controversy, no matching
of one doctrine against another, such as we find, for
instance, in the records of the controversy of Celsus
with Origen, has reached us from this period of change
and strife. The literature of ancient Ireland, as we
<pb n='52' id='page52'/>
shall see, embodied many ancient myths; and traces
appear in it of beings who must, at one time, have been
gods or elemental powers; but all has been emptied
of religious significance and turned to romance and
beauty. Yet not only was there, as C&aelig;sar tells us, a
very well-developed religious system among the Gauls,
but we learn on the same authority that the British
Islands were the authoritative centre of this system;
they were, so to speak, the Rome of the Celtic religion.
</p>

<p>
What this religion was like we have now to consider,
as an introduction to the myths and tales which more
or less remotely sprang from it.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Popular Religion of the Celts</hi>
</p>

<p>
But first we must point out that the Celtic religion
was by no means a simple affair, and cannot be summed
up as what we call <q>Druidism.</q> Beside the official
religion there was a body of popular superstitions and
observances which came from a deeper and older source
than Druidism, and was destined long to outlive it&mdash;indeed,
it is far from dead even yet.

<hi rend='bold'>The Megalithic People</hi>
</p>

<p>
The religions of primitive peoples mostly centre on,
or take their rise from, rites and practices connected
with the burial of the dead. The earliest people inhabiting
Celtic territory in the West of Europe of
whom we have any distinct knowledge are a race
without name or known history, but by their sepulchral
monuments, of which so many still exist, we can learn
a great deal about them. They were the so-called
Megalithic People,<note place='foot'><p>
From Greek <hi rend='italic'>megas</hi>, great, and <hi rend='italic'>lithos</hi>, a stone.
</p></note> the builders of dolmens, cromlechs,
and chambered tumuli, of which more than three
<pb n='53' id='page53'/>
thousand have been counted in France alone. Dolmens
are found from Scandinavia southwards, all down the
western lands of Europe to the Straits of Gibraltar, and
round by the Mediterranean coast of Spain. They
occur in some of the western islands of the Mediterranean,
and are found in Greece, where, in Mycen&aelig;,
an ancient dolmen yet stands beside the magnificent
burial-chamber of the Atreidae. Roughly, if we draw
a line from the mouth of the Rhone northward to
Varanger Fiord, one may say that, except for a few
Mediterranean examples, all the dolmens in Europe
lie to the west of that line. To the east none are
found till we come into Asia. But they cross the
Straits of Gibraltar, and are found all along the North
African littoral, and thence eastwards through Arabia,
India, and as far as Japan.

<p>
A dolmen, it may be here explained, is a kind of
chamber composed of upright unhewn stones, and
roofed generally with a single huge stone. They are

-->
usually wedge-shaped
in plan, and traces of
a porch or vestibule
can often be noticed.
The primary intention
of the dolmen was to
represent a house or
dwelling-place for the
dead. A cromlech
(often confused in
popular language with
the dolmen) is properly
a circular arrangement of standing stones, often
with a dolmen in their midst. It is believed that most
<pb n='54' id='page54'/>
if not all of the now exposed dolmens were originally
covered with a great mound of earth or of smaller stones.
Sometimes, as in the illustration we give from Carnac,
in Brittany, great avenues or alignments are formed of
single upright stones, and these, no doubt, had some
purpose connected with the ritual of worship carried
on in the locality. The later megalithic monuments,
as at Stonehenge, may be of dressed stone, but in all
cases their rudeness of construction, the absence of any
sculpturing (except for patterns or symbols incised on
the surface), the evident aim at creating a powerful impression
by the brute strength of huge monolithic masses,
as well as certain subsidiary features in their design
which shall be described later on, give these megalithic
monuments a curious family likeness and mark them
out from the chambered tombs of the early Greeks,
of the Egyptians, and of other more advanced races.
The dolmens proper gave place in the end to great
chambered mounds or tumuli, as at New Grange, which
we also reckon as belonging to the Megalithic People.
They are a natural development of the dolmen. The
early dolmen-builders were in the neolithic stage of
culture, their weapons were of polished stone. But
in the tumuli not only stone, but also bronze, and even
iron, instruments are found&mdash;at first evidently importations,
but afterwards of local manufacture.

sea for any great distance; that they migrated westwards
along North Africa, crossed into Europe where
the Mediterranean at Gibraltar narrows to a strait of a
few miles in width, and thence spread over the western
regions of Europe, including the British Islands, while
on the eastward they penetrated by Arabia into Asia. It
must, however, be borne in mind that while originally,
no doubt, a distinct race, the Megalithic People came
in the end to represent, not a race, but a culture.
The human remains found in these sepulchres, with
their wide divergence in the shape of the skull, &amp;c.,
clearly prove this.<note place='foot'><p>
See Borlase's <q>Dolmens of Ireland,</q> pp. 605, 606, for a
discussion of this question.
</p></note> These and other relics testify to the
dolmen-builders in general as representing a superior
and well-developed type, acquainted with agriculture,
pasturage, and to some extent with seafaring. The
monuments themselves, which are often of imposing
size and imply much thought and organised effort in
their construction, show unquestionably the existence,
at this period, of a priesthood charged with the care of
funeral rites and capable of controlling large bodies of
men. Their dead were, as a rule, not burned, but
buried whole&mdash;the greater monuments marking, no
doubt, the sepulchres of important personages, while
the common people were buried in tombs of which no
traces now exist.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Celts of the Plains</hi>
</p>

<p>
De Jubainville, in his account of the early history of
the Celts, takes account of two main groups only&mdash;the
Celts and the Megalithic People. But A. Bertrand, in
his very valuable work <q>La Religion des Gaulois,</q>
distinguishes two elements among the Celts themselves.
There are, besides the Megalithic People, the two groups
<pb n='56' id='page56'/>
of lowland Celts and mountain Celts. The lowland
Celts, according to his view, started from the Danube
and entered Gaul probably about 1200 B.C. They
were the founders of the lake-dwellings in Switzerland,
in the Danube valley, and in Ireland. They knew the
use of metals, and worked in gold, in tin, in bronze, and
towards the end of their period in iron. Unlike the
Megalithic People, they spoke a Celtic tongue,<note place='foot'><p>
Professor Ridgeway (see Report of the Brit. Assoc. for 1908) has
contended that the Megalithic People spoke an Aryan language;
otherwise he thinks more traces of its influence must have survived
in the Celtic which supplanted it. The weight of authority, as
well as such direct evidence as we possess, seems to be against his view.
</p></note> though
Bertrand seems to doubt their genuine racial affinity
with the true Celts. They were perhaps Celticised
rather than actually Celtic. They were not warlike;
a quiet folk of herdsmen, tillers, and artificers. They
did not bury, but burned their dead. At a great settlement
of theirs, Golasecca, in Cisalpine Gaul, 6000 interments
were found. In each case the body had been
burned; there was not a single burial without previous
burning.
</p>

<p>
This people entered Gaul not (according to Bertrand),
for the most part, as conquerors, but by gradual infiltration,
occupying vacant spaces wherever they found them
along the valleys and plains. They came by the passes
of the Alps, and their starting-point was the country of
the Upper Danube, which Herodotus says <q>rises among
the Celts.</q> They blended peacefully with the Megalithic
People among whom they settled, and did not
evolve any of those advanced political institutions which
are only nursed in war, but probably they contributed
powerfully to the development of the Druidical system
of religion and to the bardic poetry.
</p>


<pb n='57' id='page57'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Celts of the Mountains</hi>
</p>

<p>
Finally, we have a third group, the true Celtic group,
which followed closely on the track of the second. It
was at the beginning of the sixth century that it first
made its appearance on the left bank of the Rhine.
While Bertrand calls the second group Celtic, these he
styles Galatic, and identifies them with the Galat&aelig; of
the Greeks and the Galli and Belg&aelig; of the Romans.
</p>

<p>
The second group, as we have said, were Celts of the
plains. The third were Celts of the mountains. The
earliest home in which we know them was the ranges
of the Balkans and Carpathians. Their organisation
was that of a military aristocracy&mdash;they lorded it over
the subject populations on whom they lived by tribute
or pillage. They are the warlike Celts of ancient history&mdash;the
sackers of Rome and Delphi, the mercenary
warriors who fought for pay and for the love of warfare
in the ranks of Carthage and afterwards of Rome.
Agriculture and industry were despised by them, their
women tilled the ground, and under their rule the
common population became reduced almost to servitude;
<q>plebs pœne servorum habetur loco,</q> as Caesar tells us.
Ireland alone escaped in some degree from the oppression
of this military aristocracy, and from the sharp dividing
line which it drew between the classes, yet even there a
reflexion of the state of things in Gaul is found, even
there we find free and unfree tribes and oppressive and
dishonouring exactions on the part of the ruling order.
</p>

<p>
Yet, if this ruling race had some of the vices of untamed
strength, they had also many noble and humane
qualities. They were dauntlessly brave, fantastically
chivalrous, keenly sensitive to the appeal of poetry, of
music, and of speculative thought. Posidonius found
the bardic institution flourishing among them about
<pb n='58' id='page58'/>
100 B.C.,and about two hundred years earlier Hecat&aelig;us of
Abdera describes the elaborate musical services held by
the Celts in a Western island&mdash;probably Great Britain&mdash;in
honour of their god Apollo (Lugh).<note place='foot'><p>
See Holder,<q>Altceltischer Sprachschatz.</q> <hi rend='italic'>sulb voce</hi> <q>Hyperboreoi.</q>
</p></note> Aryan of the
Aryans, they had in them the making of a great and progressive
nation; but the Druidic system&mdash;not on the
side of its philosophy and science, but on that of its
ecclesiastico-political organisation&mdash;was their bane, and
their submission to it was their fatal weakness.
</p>

<p>
The culture of these mountain Celts differed markedly
from that of the lowlanders. Their age was the age of
iron, not of bronze; their dead were not burned (which
they considered a disgrace), but buried.
</p>

<p>
The territories occupied by them in force were
Switzerland, Burgundy, the Palatinate, and Northern
France, parts of Britain to the west, and Illyria and
Galatia to the east, but smaller groups of them must
have penetrated far and wide through all Celtic territory,
and taken up a ruling position wherever they went.

<p>
There were three peoples, said C&aelig;sar, inhabiting
Gaul when his conquest began; <q>they differ from
each other in language, in customs, and in laws.</q>
These people he named respectively the Belg&aelig;, the
Celt&aelig;, and the Aquitani. He locates them roughly, the
Belg&aelig; in the north and east, the Celt&aelig; in the middle,
and the Aquitani in the west and south. The Belg&aelig;
are the Galat&aelig; of Bertrand, the Celt&aelig; are the Celts,
and the Aquitani are the Megalithic People. They
had, of course, all been more or less brought under
Celtic influences, and the differences of language which
C&aelig;sar noticed need not have been great; still it is
noteworthy, and quite in accordance with Bertrand's
views, that Strabo speaks of the Aquitani as differing
markedly from the rest of the inhabitants, and as

resembling the Iberians. The language of the other
Gaulish peoples, he expressly adds, were merely
dialects of the same tongue.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Religion of Magic</hi>
</p>

<p>
This triple division is reflected more or less in all
the Celtic countries, and must always be borne in mind
when we speak of Celtic ideas and Celtic religion, and
try to estimate the contribution of the Celtic peoples to
European culture. The mythical literature and the
art of the Celt have probably sprung mainly from the
section represented by the Lowland Celts of Bertrand.
But this literature of song and saga was produced by a
bardic class for the pleasure and instruction of a proud,
chivalrous, and warlike aristocracy, and would thus
inevitably be moulded by the ideas of this aristocracy.
But it would also have been coloured by the profound
influence of the religious beliefs and observances
entertained by the Megalithic People&mdash;beliefs which
are only now fading slowly away in the spreading daylight
of science. These beliefs may be summed up in
the one term Magic. The nature of this religion of
magic must now be briefly discussed, for it was a
potent element in the formation of the body of myths
and legends with which we have afterwards to deal.
And, as Professor Bury remarked in his Inaugural
Lecture at Cambridge, in 1903:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>For the purpose of prosecuting that most difficult
of all inquiries, the ethnical problem, the part played
by race in the development of peoples and the effects
of race-blendings, it must be remembered that the
Celtic world commands one of the chief portals of
ingress into that mysterious pre-Aryan foreworld, from
which it may well be that we modern Europeans have
inherited far more than we dream.</q>
</q>
</p>


<pb n='60' id='page60'/>

<p>
The ultimate root of the word Magic is unknown,
but proximately it is derived from the Magi, or priests
of Chaldea and Media in pre-Aryan and pre-Semitic
times, who were the great exponents of this system of
thought, so strangely mingled of superstition, philosophy,
and scientific observation. The fundamental
conception of magic is that of the spiritual vitality of all
nature. This spiritual vitality was not, as in polytheism,
conceived as separated from nature in distinct divine
personalities. It was implicit and immanent in nature;
obscure, undefined, invested with all the awfulness of a
power whose limits and nature are enveloped in impenetrable
mystery. In its remote origin it was doubtless,
as many facts appear to show, associated with the
cult of the dead, for death was looked upon as the resumption
into nature, and as the investment with vague
and uncontrollable powers, of a spiritual force formerly
embodied in the concrete, limited, manageable, and
therefore less awful form of a living human personality.
Yet these powers were not altogether uncontrollable.
The desire for control, as well as the suggestion of the
means for achieving it, probably arose from the first
rude practices of the art of healing. Medicine of
some sort was one of the earliest necessities of man.
And the power of certain natural substances, mineral
or vegetable, to produce bodily and mental effects
often of a most startling character would naturally
be taken as signal evidence of what we may call the
<q>magical</q> conception of the universe.<note place='foot'><p>
Thus the Greek <hi rend='italic'>pharmakon</hi>=medicine, poison, or charm; and I
am informed that the Central African word for magic or charm is
<hi rend='italic'>mankwala</hi>, which also means medicine.
</p></note> The first
magicians were those who attained a special knowledge
of healing or poisonous herbs; but <q>virtue</q> of some
sort being attributed to every natural object and phenomenon,
<pb n='61' id='page61'/>
a kind of magical science, partly the child of
true research, partly of poetic imagination, partly of
priestcraft, would in time spring up, would be codified
into rites and formulas, attached to special places and
objects, and represented by symbols. The whole
subject has been treated by Pliny in a remarkable
passage which deserves quotation at length:
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Pliny on the Religion of Magic</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q rend='post: none'>Magic is one of the few things which it is important
to discuss at some length, were it only because,
being the most delusive of all the arts, it has everywhere
and at all times been most powerfully credited. Nor
need it surprise us that it has obtained so vast an
influence, for it has united in itself the three arts which
have wielded the most powerful sway over the spirit of
man. Springing in the first instance from Medicine&mdash;a
fact which no one can doubt&mdash;and under cover of a
solicitude for our health, it has glided into the mind,
and taken the form of another medicine, more holy
and more profound. In the second place, bearing the
most seductive and flattering promises, it has enlisted
the motive of Religion, the subject on which, even at
this day, mankind is most in the dark. To crown all
it has had recourse to the art of Astrology; and every
man is eager to know the future and convinced that
this knowledge is most certainly to be obtained from the
heavens. Thus, holding the minds of men enchained
in this triple bond, it has extended its sway over many
nations, and the Kings of Kings obey it in the East.</q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the East, doubtless, it was invented&mdash;in Persia
and by Zoroaster.<note place='foot'><p>
If Pliny meant that it was here first codified and organised he
may be right, but the conceptions on which magic rest are practically
universal, and of immemorial antiquity.
</p></note> All the authorities agree in this.
<pb n='62' id='page62'/>
But has there not been more than one Zoroaster?...
I have noticed that in ancient times, and indeed almost
always, one finds men seeking in this science the
climax of literary glory&mdash;at least Pythagoras, Empedocles,
Democritus, and Plato crossed the seas, exiles,
in truth, rather than travellers, to instruct themselves
in this. Returning to their native land, they vaunted
the claims of magic and maintained its secret doctrine.... 
In the Latin nations there are early traces of it,
as, for instance, in our Laws of the Twelve Tables<note place='foot'><p>
Adopted 451 B.C. Livy entitles them <q>the fountain of all public
and private right.</q> They stood in the Forum till the third century
A.D., but have now perished, except for fragments preserved in various
commentaries.
</p></note> and
other monuments, as I have said in a former book. In
fact, it was not until the year 657 after the foundation
of Rome, under the consulate of Cornelius Lentulus
Crassus, that it was forbidden by a <hi rend='italic'>senatus consultum</hi>
to sacrifice human beings; a fact which proves that up
to this date these horrible sacrifices were made. The
Gauls have been captivated by it, and that even down
to our own times, for it was the Emperor Tiberius who
suppressed the Druids and all the herd of prophets
and medicine-men. But what is the use of launching
prohibitions against an art which has thus traversed
the ocean and penetrated even to the confines of
Nature?</q> (<hi rend='italic'>Hist. Nat.</hi> xxx.)
</p>

<p>
Pliny adds that the first person whom he can
ascertain to have written on this subject was Osthanes,
who accompanied Xerxes in his war against the Greeks,
and who propagated the <q>germs of his monstrous art</q>
wherever he went in Europe.
</p>

<p>
Magic was not&mdash;so Pliny believed&mdash;indigenous either
in Greece or in Italy, but was so much at home in
Britain and conducted with such elaborate ritual that
<pb n='63' id='page63'/>
Pliny says it would almost seem as if it was they
who had taught it to the Persians, not the Persians to them.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Traces of Magic in Megalithic Monuments</hi>
</p>

<p>
The imposing relics of their cult which the Megalithic
People have left us are full of indications of their
religion. Take, for instance, the remarkable tumulus
of Mané-er-H'oeck, in Brittany. This monument was
explored in 1864 by M. René Galles, who describes it
as absolutely intact&mdash;the surface of the earth unbroken,
and everything as the builders left it.<note place='foot'><p>
See <q>Revue Archeologique,</q> t. xii., 1865, <q>Fouilles de René Galles.</q>
</p></note> At the entrance
to the rectangular chamber was a sculptured slab, on
which was graven a mysterious sign, perhaps the totem
of a chief. Immediately on entering the chamber was
found a beautiful pendant in green jasper about the
size of an egg. On the floor in the centre of the
chamber was a most singular arrangement, consisting of
a large ring of jadite, slightly oval in shape, with a
magnificent axe-head, also of jadite, its point resting on
the ring. The axe was a well-known symbol of power
or godhead, and is frequently found in rock-carvings of
the Bronze Age, as well as in Egyptian hieroglyphs,
Minoan carvings, &amp;c. At a little distance from these
there lay two large pendants of jasper, then an axe-head
in white jade,<note place='foot'><p>
Jade is not found in the native state in Europe, nor nearer than China.
</p></note> then another jasper pendant. All
these objects were ranged with evident intention <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>en suite</foreign>,
forming a straight line which coincided exactly with
one of the diagonals of the chamber, running from
north-west to south-east. In one of the corners of the
chamber were found 101 axe-heads in jade, jadite, and
<pb n='64' id='page64'/>
fibrolite. There were no traces of bones or cinders, no
funerary urn; the structure was a cenotaph. <q>Are
we not here,</q> asks Bertrand, <q>in presence of some
ceremony relating to the practices of magic?</q>

M. Albert Maitre, an inspector of the Musée des Antiquités
Nationales. There were found here&mdash;as commonly
in other megalithic monuments in Ireland and
Scotland&mdash;a number of stones sculptured with a singular
and characteristic design in waving and concentric lines.
Now if the curious lines traced upon the human hand
at the roots and tips of the fingers be examined under
a lens, it will be found that they bear an exact resemblance
to these designs of megalithic sculpture. One
seems almost like a cast of the other. These lines on
the human hand are so distinct and peculiar that, as is
well known, they have been adopted as a method of
identification of criminals. Can this resemblance be
<pb n='65' id='page65'/>
the result of chance? Nothing like these peculiar
assemblages of sculptured lines has ever been found
except in connexion with these monuments. Have we
not here a reference to chiromancy&mdash;a magical art much
practised in ancient and even in modern times? The
hand as a symbol of power was a well-known magical
emblem, and has entered largely even into Christian
symbolism&mdash;note, for instance, the great hand sculptured
on the under side of one of the arms of the Cross of
Muiredach at Monasterboice.

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Stone-Worship</hi>
</p>

<p>
Besides the heavenly bodies, we find that rivers, trees,
mountains, and stones were all objects of veneration
among this primitive people. Stone-worship was particularly
common, and is not so easily explained as the
worship directed toward objects possessing movement
and vitality. Possibly an explanation of the veneration
attaching to great and isolated masses of unhewn stone
may be found in their resemblance to the artificial
dolmens and cromlechs.<note place='foot'><p>
Small stones, crystals, and gems were, however, also venerated.
The celebrated Black Stone of Pergamos was the subject of an embassy
from Rome to that city in the time of the Second Punic War, the
Sibylline Books having predicted victory to its possessors. It was
brought to Rome with great rejoicings in the year 205. It is stated
to have been about the size of a man's fist, and was probably a
meteorite. Compare the myth in Hesiod which relates how Kronos
devoured a stone in the belief that it was his offspring, Zeus. It was
then possible to mistake a stone for a god.
</p></note> No superstition has proved
more enduring. In A.D. 452 we find the Synod of
Arles denouncing those who <q>venerate trees and wells
and stones,</q> and the denunciation was repeated by
Charlemagne, and by numerous Synods and Councils
down to recent times. Yet a drawing, here reproduced,
which was lately made on the spot by Mr. Arthur Bell<note place='foot'><p>

shows this very act of worship still in full force in Brittany,
and shows the symbols and the sacerdotal organisation
of Christianity actually pressed into the service of this
immemorial paganism. According to Mr. Bell, the
clergy take part in these performances with much
reluctance, but are compelled to do so by the force of
local opinion. Holy wells, the water of which is supposed
to cure diseases, are still very common in Ireland,

with megalithic monuments. The accompanying
illustrations show examples of it. Cup-shaped
hollows are made in the surface of the stone, these are
often surrounded with concentric rings, and from the
cup one or more radial lines are drawn to a point outside
the circumference of the rings. Occasionally a
system of cups are joined by these lines, but more frequently
they end a little way outside the widest of the
rings. These strange markings are found in Great
Britain and Ireland, in Brittany, and at various places in

See Sir J. Simpson's <q>Archaic Sculpturings</q> 1867.
</p></note> I have also
found a curious example&mdash;for such it appears to be&mdash;in
Dupaix' <q>Monuments of New Spain.</q> It is reproduced
in Lord Kingsborough's <q>Antiquities of Mexico,</q>
vol. iv. On the circular top of a cylindrical stone,
known as the <q>Triumphal Stone,</q> is carved a central
cup, with nine concentric circles round it, and a duct or
channel cut straight from the cup through all the
circles to the rim. Except that the design here is richly
decorated and accurately drawn, it closely resembles a
typical European cup-and-ring marking. That these
markings mean something, and that, wherever they are
found, they mean the same thing, can hardly be doubted,
but what that meaning is remains yet a puzzle to antiquarians.
The guess may perhaps be hazarded that
they are diagrams or plans of a megalithic sepulchre.
The central hollow represents the actual burial-place.
The circles are the standing stones, fosses, and ramparts
which often surrounded it; and the line or duct drawn
from the centre outwards represents the subterranean
approach to the sepulchre. The apparent <q>avenue</q>
intention of the duct is clearly brought out in the
varieties given below, which I take from Simpson. As

the sepulchre was also a
holy place or shrine, the
occurrence of a representation
of it among other
carvings of a sacred character
is natural enough; it
would seem symbolically
to indicate that the place
was holy ground. How far this suggestion might
apply to the Mexican example I am unable to
say.

<hi rend='bold'>The Tumulus at New Grange</hi>
</p>

<p>
One of the most important and richly sculptured of
European megalithic monuments is the great chambered
tumulus of New Grange, on the northern bank of the
Boyne, in Ireland. This tumulus, and the others which
occur in its neighbourhood, appear in ancient Irish
mythical literature in two different characters, the union
of which is significant. They are regarded on the one
hand as the dwelling-places of the <hi rend='italic'>Sidhe</hi> (pronounced
Shee), or Fairy Folk, who represent, probably, the deities
of the ancient Irish, and they are also, traditionally, the
burial-places of the Celtic High Kings of pagan Ireland.
The story of the burial of King Cormac, who was
supposed to have heard of the Christian faith long
before it was actually preached in Ireland by St. Patrick
and who ordered that he should not be buried at the
royal cemetery by the Boyne, on account of its pagan
associations, points to the view that this place was the
centre of a pagan cult involving more than merely the
interment of royal personages in its precincts. Unfortunately
these monuments are not intact; they were
opened and plundered by the Danes in the ninth
century,<note place='foot'><p>
The fact is recorded in the <q>Annals of the Four Masters</q>
Under the date 861, and in the <q>Annals of Ulster</q> under 862.
</p></note> but enough evidence remains to show that
they were sepulchral in their origin, and were also
associated with the cult of a primitive religion. The
most important of them, the tumulus of New Grange,
has been thoroughly explored and described by Mr.
George Coffey, keeper of the collection of Celtic antiquities
in the National Museum, Dublin.<note place='foot'><p>
See <q>Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,</q> vol. xxx. pt. i.,
1892, and <q>New Grange,</q> by G. Coffey, 1912.
</p></note> It appears
from the outside like a large mound, or knoll, now overgrown
with bushes. It measures about 280 feet across,
<pb n='70' id='page70'/>
<!-- Missing from original scans, may contain errors -->
at its greatest diameter, and is about 44 feet in height.
Outside it there runs a wide circle of standing stones
originally, it would seem, thirty-five in number. Inside
this circle is a ditch and rampart, and on top of this
rampart was laid a circular curb of great stones 8 to 10
feet long, laid on edge, and confining what has proved to
be a huge mound of loose stones, now overgrown, as
we have said, with grass and bushes. It is in the interior
of this mound that the interest of the monument
lies. Towards the end of the seventeenth century some
workmen who were getting road-material from the
mound came across the entrance to a passage which led
into the interior, and was marked by the fact that the
boundary stone below it is richly carved with spirals and
lozenges. This entrance faces exactly south-east. The
passage is formed of upright slabs of unhewn stone
roofed with similar slabs, and varies from nearly 5 feet
to 7 feet 10 inches in height; it is about 3 feet wide, and
runs for 62 feet straight into the heart of the mound.
Here it ends in a cruciform chamber, 20 feet high, the
roof, a kind of dome, being formed of large flat stones,
overlapping inwards till they almost meet at the top, where
a large flat stone covers all. In each of the three recesses
of the cruciform chamber there stands a large
stone basin, or rude sarcophagus, but not traces of any
burial now remains.

<hi rend='bold'>Symbolic Carvings at New Grange</hi>
</p>

<p>
The stones are all raw and undressed, and were
selected for their purpose from the river-bed and elsewhere
close by. On their flat surfaces, obtained by
splitting slabs from the original quarries, are found the
carvings which form the unique interest of this strange
monument. Except for the large stone with spiral
carvings and one other at the entrance to the mound,

the intention of these sculptures does not appear to have
been decorative, except in a very rude and primitive
sense. There is no attempt to cover a given surface
with a system of ornament appropriate to its size and
shape. The designs are, as it were, scribbled upon the
walls anyhow and anywhere.<note place='foot'><p>
It must be observed, however, that the decoration was, certainly,
in some, and perhaps in all cases, carried out before the stones were
placed in position. This is also the case at Gavr'inis.
</p></note> Among them everywhere
the spiral is prominent. The resemblance of some of
these carvings to the supposed finger-markings of the
stones at Gavr'inis is very remarkable. Triple and
double spiral are also found, as well as lozenges and
zigzags. A singular carving representing what looks
like a palm-branch or fern-leaf is found in the west
recess. The drawing of this object is naturalistic, and
it is hard to interpret it, as Mr. Coffey is inclined to do,
as merely a piece of so-called <q>herring-bone</q> pattern.<note place='foot'><p>
He has modified this view in his latest work, <q>New Grange,</q> 1912.
</p></note>
A similar palm-leaf design, but with the ribs arranged
at right angles to the central axis, is found in the
neighbouring tumulus of Dowth, at Loughcrew, and
in combination with a solar emblem, the swastika, on a
small altar in the Pyrenees, figured by Bertrand.

Another remarkable and, as far as Ireland goes,
unusual figure is found sculptured in the west recess at
New Grange. It has been interpreted by various critics
as a mason's mark, a piece of Phoenician writing, a
group of numerals, and finally (and no doubt correctly)
by Mr. George Coffey as a rude representation of a ship
with men on board and uplifted sail. It is noticeable
that just above it is a small circle, forming, apparently,
part of the design. Another example occurs at Dowth.

these ships (which, like

often so summarily represented
as to be mere

improbable. In the days of the megalithic folk a
sepulchral monument, the very focus of religious ideas,
would hardly have been covered
with idle and meaningless scrawls.

said, <q>has ever conjoined together
things sacred and things sepulchral.</q>
Nor do these scrawls, in
the majority of instances, show
any glimmering of a decorative
intention. But if they had a symbolic intention, what
is it that they symbolise?

<hi rend='bold'>The Ship Symbol in Egypt</hi>
</p>

<p>
Now this symbol of the ship, with or without the actual
portrayal of the solar emblem, is of very ancient and
<pb n='74' id='page74'/>
very common occurrence in the sepulchral art of Egypt.
It is connected with the worship of Rā, which came in fully
4000 years B.C. Its meaning as an Egyptian symbol is
well known. The ship was called the Boat of the Sun.
It was the vessel in which the Sun-god performed his
journeys; in particular, the journey which he made
nightly to the shores of the Other-world, bearing with
him in his bark the souls of the beatified dead. The
<!--

</figure>
-->
Sun-god, Rā, is sometimes represented by a disk, sometimes
by other emblems, hovering above the vessel or
contained within it. Any one who will look over the
painted or sculptured sarcophagi in the British Museum
will find a host of examples. Sometimes he will find
representations of the life-giving rays of Rā pouring down
upon the boat and its occupants. Now, in one of the
Swedish rock-carvings of ships at Backa, Bohuslän, given
by Montelius, a ship crowded with figures is shown
beneath a disk with three descending rays, and again
another ship with a two-rayed sun above it. It may
be added that in the tumulus of Dowth, which is close
to that of New Grange and is entirely of the same character
and period, rayed figures and quartered circles,
obviously solar emblems, occur abundantly, as also at
Loughcrew and other places in Ireland, and one other
ship figure has been identified at Dowth

contains a crowd of passengers
representing human
souls, and sometimes the
figure of a single corpse on
a bier. The megalithic carvings
also sometimes show
the solar emblem and sometimes
not; the boats are sometimes filled with figures
and are sometimes empty. When a symbol has once
been accepted and understood, any conventional or
summary representation of it is sufficient. I take it
<!--

<p>(<hi rend='italic'>British Museum</hi>)</p>
</figure>-->
that the complete form of
the megalithic symbol is
that of a boat with figures
in it and with the solar
emblem overhead. These
figures, assuming the foregoing
interpretation of
the design to be correct,
must clearly be taken
for representations of
the dead on their way to the Other-world. They
cannot be deities, for representations of the divine
powers under human aspect were quite unknown to
the Megalithic People, even after the coming of the
Celts&mdash;they first occur in Gaul under Roman influence.
But if these figures represent the dead, then we have
clearly before us the origin of the so-called <q>Celtic</q>
doctrine of immortality. The carvings in question are
pre-Celtic. They are found where no Celts ever penetrated.
Yet they point to the existence of just that
Other-world doctrine which, from the time of C&aelig;sar
<pb n='76' id='page76'/>
downwards, has been associated with Celtic Druidism,
and this doctrine was distinctively Egyptian.

<hi rend='bold'>The <q>Navetas</q></hi>
</p>

<p>
In connexion with this subject I may draw attention to
the theory of Mr. W.C. Borlase that the typical design
of an Irish dolmen was intended to represent a ship.
In Minorca there are analogous structures, there popularly
called <hi rend='italic'>navetas</hi> (ships), so distinct is the resemblance.
But, he adds, <q>long before the caves and <hi rend='italic'>navetas</hi> of
Minorca were known to me I had formed the opinion
that what I have so frequently spoken of as the <q>wedge-shape</q>
observable so universally in the ground-plans of
dolmens was due to an original conception of a ship.
From sepulchral tumuli in Scandinavia we know actual
vessels have on several occasions been disinterred. In
cemeteries of the Iron Age, in the same country, as
well as on the more southern Baltic coasts, the ship
was a recognised form of sepulchral enclosure.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Dolmens of Ireland,</q> pp. 701-704.
</p></note> If
Mr. Borlase's view is correct, we have here a very
strong corroboration of the symbolic intention which
I attribute to the solar ship-carvings of the Megalithic
People.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Ship Symbol in Babylonia</hi>
</p>

<p>
The ship symbol, it may be remarked, can be traced
to about 4000 B.C. in Babylonia, where every deity had
his own special ship (that of the god Sin was called
the Ship of Light), his image being carried in procession
on a litter formed like a ship. This is thought
by Jastrow<note place='foot'><p>
<q>The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria.</q>
</p></note> to have originated at a time when the sacred
cities of Babylonia were situated on the Persian Gulf,
and when religious processions were often carried out
by water.

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Symbol of the Feet</hi>
</p>

<p>
Yet there is reason to think that some of these symbols
were earlier than any known mythology, and were,
so to say, mythologised differently by different peoples,
who got hold of them from this now unknown source.
A remarkable instance is that of the symbol of the Two
Feet. In Egypt the Feet of Osiris formed one of the
<!--<figure url='images/ill-080.png' rend='text-align: center; page-float: "htb"'>
<head>The Two

portions into which his body was cut up, in
the well-known myth. They were a symbol
of possession or of visitation. <q>I have come
upon earth,</q> says the <q>Book of the Dead</q>
(ch. xvii.), <q>and with my two feet have taken
possession, I am Tmu.</q> Now this symbol
of the feet or footprint is very widespread.
It is found in India, as the print of the foot of Buddha,<note place='foot'><p>
A good example from Amaravati (after Fergusson) is given by

<p>
Approaching the subject from the linguistic side,
Rhys and Brynmor Jones find that the African origin&mdash;at
least proximately&mdash;of the primitive population of
Great Britain and Ireland is strongly suggested. It is
here shown that the Celtic languages preserve in their
syntax the Hamitic, and especially the Egyptian type.<note place='foot'><p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Egyptian and <q>Celtic</q> Ideas of Immortality</hi>
</p>

<p>
The facts at present known do not, I think, justify
us in framing any theory as to the actual historical
relation of the dolmen-builders of Western Europe with
the people who created the wonderful religion and
civilisation of ancient Egypt. But when we consider
all the lines of evidence that converge in this direction
it seems clear that there was such a relation. Egypt
was the classic land of religious symbolism. It gave to
<pb n='79' id='page79'/>
Europe the most beautiful and most popular of all its
religious symbols, that of the divine mother and child<note place='foot'><p>
Flinders Petrie, <q>Egypt and Israel,</q> pp. 137, 899.
</p></note>.
I believe that it also gave to the primitive inhabitants of
Western Europe the profound symbol of the voyaging
spirits guided to the world of the dead by the God of
Light.
</p>

<p>
The religion of Egypt, above that of any people
whose ideas we know to have been developed in times
so ancient, centred on the doctrine of a future life.
The palatial and stupendous tombs, the elaborate ritual,
the imposing mythology, the immense exaltation of the
priestly caste, all these features of Egyptian culture
were intimately connected with their doctrine of the
immortality of the soul.
</p>

<p>
To the Egyptian the disembodied soul was no
shadowy simulacrum, as the classical nations believed&mdash;the
future life was a mere prolongation of the present;
the just man, when he had won his place in it, found
himself among his relatives, his friends, his workpeople,
with tasks and enjoyments very much like those of
earth. The doom of the wicked was annihilation; he
fell a victim to the invisible monster called the Eater of
the Dead.
</p>

<p>
Now when the classical nations first began to take
an interest in the ideas of the Celts the thing that principally
struck them was the Celtic belief in immortality,
which the Gauls said was <q>handed down by the
Druids.</q> The classical nations believed in immortality;
but what a picture does Homer, the Bible of
the Greeks, give of the lost, degraded, dehumanised
creatures which represented the departed souls of men!
Take, as one example, the description of the spirits of
the suitors slain by Odysseus as Hermes conducts them
to the Underworld:
</p>


<pb n='80' id='page80'/>

<l>Squeal as they flutter around, should one from the cluster be fallen</l>
<l>Where from the rock suspended they hung, all clinging together;</l>
<l>So did the souls flock squealing behind him, as Hermes the Helper</l>

<p>
The classical writers felt rightly that the Celtic idea
of immortality was something altogether different from
this. It was both loftier and more realistic; it implied
a true persistence of the living man, as he was at present,
in all his human relations. They noted with surprise
that the Celt would lend money on a promissory note for
repayment in the next world.<note place='foot'><p>
Valerius Maximus (about A.D 30) and other classical writers
mention this practice.
</p></note> That is an absolutely
Egyptian conception. And this very analogy occurred
to Diodorus in writing of the Celtic idea of immortality&mdash;it
was like nothing that he knew of out of Egypt.<note place='foot'><p>
Book V.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Doctrine of Transmigration</hi>
</p>

<p>
Many ancient writers assert that the Celtic idea of
immortality embodied the Oriental conception of the
transmigration of souls, and to account for this the
hypothesis was invented that they had learned the
doctrine from Pythagoras, who represented it in classical
antiquity. Thus C&aelig;sar: <q>The principal point of their
[the Druids'] teaching is that the soul does not perish,
and that after death it passes from one body into
another.</q> And Diodorus: <q>Among them the doctrine
of Pythagoras prevails, according to which the souls of
men are immortal, and after a fixed term recommence
<pb n='81' id='page81'/>
to live, taking upon themselves a new body.</q> Now
traces of this doctrine certainly do appear in Irish
legend. Thus the Irish chieftain, Mongan, who is an
historical personage, and whose death is recorded about
A.D. 625, is said to have made a wager as to the
place of death of a king named Fothad, slain in a battle
with the mythical hero Finn mac Cumhal in the third
century. He proves his case by summoning to his aid
a <hi rend='italic'>revenant</hi> from the Other-world, Keelta, who was the
actual slayer of Fothad, and who describes correctly
where the tomb is to be found and what were its
contents. He begins his tale by saying to Mongan,
<q>We were with thee,</q> and then, turning to the assembly,
he continues: <q>We were with Finn, coming from
Alba....</q> <q>Hush,</q> says Mongan, <q>it is wrong of
thee to reveal a secret.</q> The secret is, of course, that
Mongan was a reincarnation of Finn.<note place='foot'><p>
De Jubainville, <q>Irish Mythological Cycle,</q> p.191 <hi rend='italic'>sqq.</hi>
</p></note> But the evidence
on the whole shows that the Celts did not hold this
doctrine at all in the same way as Pythagoras and the
Orientals did. Transmigration was not, with them, part
of the order of things. It <hi rend='italic'>might</hi> happen, but in general
it did not; the new body assumed by the dead clothed
them in another, not in this world, and so far as we
can learn from any ancient authority, there does not
appear to have been any idea of moral retribution
connected with this form of the future life. It was not
so much an article of faith as an idea which haunted the
imagination, and which, as Mongan's caution indicates,
ought not to be brought into clear light.
</p>

<p>
However it may have been conceived, it is certain
that the belief in immortality was the basis of Celtic
Druidism.<note place='foot'><p>
The etymology of the word <q>Druid</q> is no longer an unsolved
problem. It had been suggested that the latter part of the word
might be connected with the Aryan root VID, which appears in
<q>wisdom,</q> in the Latin <hi rend='italic'>videre</hi>, &amp;c., Thurneysen has now shown that
this root in combination with the intensive particle <hi rend='italic'>dru</hi> would yield
the word <hi rend='italic'>dru-vids</hi>, represented in Gaelic by <hi rend='italic'>draoi</hi>, a Druid, just as
another intensive, <hi rend='italic'>su</hi>, with <hi rend='italic'>vids</hi> yields the Gaelic <hi rend='italic'>saoi</hi>, a sage.
</p></note> Caesar affirms this distinctly, and declares
<pb n='82' id='page82'/>
the doctrine to have been fostered by the Druids rather
for the promotion of courage than for purely religious
reasons. An intense Other-world faith, such as that
held by the Celts, is certainly one of the mightiest of
agencies in the hands of a priesthood who hold the
keys of that world. Now Druidism existed in the
British Islands, in Gaul, and, in fact, so far as we know,
wherever there was a Celtic race amid a population of
dolmen-builders. There were Celts in Cisalpine Gaul,
but there were no dolmens there, and there were no
Druids.<note place='foot'><p>
See Rice Holmes, <q>C&aelig;sar's Conquest,</q> p. 15, and pp. 532-536.
Rhys, it may be observed, believes that Druidism was the religion of
the aboriginal inhabitants of Western Europe <q>from the Baltic to
Gibraltar</q> (<q>Celtic Britain,</q> p. 73). But we only <hi rend='italic'>know</hi> of it
where Celts and dolmen-builders combined. C&aelig;sar remarks of the
Germans that they had no Druids and cared little about sacrificial
ceremonies.
</p></note> What is quite clear is that when the Celts
got to Western Europe they found there a people with
a powerful priesthood, a ritual, and imposing religious
monuments; a people steeped in magic and mysticism
and the cult of the Underworld. The inferences, as I
read the facts, seem to be that Druidism in its essential
features was imposed upon the imaginative and sensitive
nature of the Celt&mdash;the Celt with his <q>extraordinary
aptitude</q> for picking up ideas&mdash;by the earlier population
of Western Europe, the Megalithic People,
while, as held by these, it stands in some historical
relation, which I am not able to pursue in further
detail, with the religious culture of ancient Egypt.
Much obscurity still broods over the question,
and perhaps will always do so, but if these
<pb n='83' id='page83'/>
suggestions have anything in them, then the Megalithic
People have been brought a step or two out of the
atmosphere of uncanny mystery which has surrounded
them, and they are shown to have played a very important
part in the religious development of Western
Europe, and in preparing that part of the world for the
rapid extension of the special type of Christianity which
took place in it. Bertrand, in his most interesting
chapter on <q>L'Irlande Celtique,</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Rel. des Gaulois,</q> leçon xx.
</p></note> points out that very
soon after the conversion of Ireland to Christianity, we
find the country covered with monasteries, whose complete
organisation seems to indicate that they were really
Druidic colleges transformed <hi rend='italic'>en masse</hi>. C&aelig;sar has told
us what these colleges were like in Gaul. They were
very numerous. In spite of the severe study and
discipline involved, crowds flocked into them for the
sake of the power wielded by the Druidic order, and
the civil immunities which its members of all grades
enjoyed. Arts and sciences were studied there, and
thousands of verses enshrining the teachings of Druidism
were committed to memory. All this is very like what
we know of Irish Druidism. Such an organisation
would pass into Christianity of the type established in
Ireland with very little difficulty. The belief in magical
rites would survive&mdash;early Irish Christianity, as its
copious hagiography plainly shows, was as steeped in
magical ideas as ever was Druidic paganism. The
belief in immortality would remain, as before, the
cardinal doctrine of religion. Above all the supremacy
of the sacerdotal order over the temporal power would
remain unimpaired; it would still be true, as Dion
Chrysostom said of the Druids, that <q>it is they who
command, and kings on thrones of gold, dwelling in
<pb n='84' id='page84'/>
splendid palaces, are but their ministers, and the
servants of their thought.</q><note place='foot'><p>
Quoted by Bertrand, <hi rend='italic'>op. cit.</hi> p. 279.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>C&aelig;sar on the Druidic Culture</hi>
</p>

<p>
The religious, philosophic, and scientific culture
superintended by the Druids is spoken of by C&aelig;sar
with much respect. <q>They discuss and impart to the
youth,</q> he writes, <q>many things respecting the stars
and their motions, respecting the extent of the universe
and of our earth, respecting the nature of things, respecting
the power and the majesty of the immortal
gods</q> (bk. vi. 14). We would give much to know
some particulars of the teaching here described. But
the Druids, though well acquainted with letters, strictly
forbade the committal of their doctrines to writing; an
extremely sagacious provision, for not only did they
thus surround their teaching with that atmosphere of
mystery which exercises so potent a spell over the
human mind, but they ensured that it could never be
effectively controverted.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Human Sacrifices in Gaul</hi>
</p>

<p>
In strange discord, however, with the lofty words of
C&aelig;sar stands the abominable practice of human sacrifice
whose prevalence he noted among the Celts. Prisoners
and criminals, or if these failed even innocent victims,
probably children, were encased, numbers at a time, in
huge frames of wickerwork, and there burned alive to
win the favour of the gods. The practice of human
sacrifice is, of course, not specially Druidic&mdash;it is found
in all parts both of the Old and of the New World at a
certain stage of culture, and was doubtless a survival
from the time of the Megalithic People. The fact that
it should have continued in Celtic lands after an otherwise
<pb n='85' id='page85'/>
fairly high state of civilisation and religious culture
had been attained can be paralleled from Mexico and
Carthage, and in both cases is due, no doubt, to the
uncontrolled dominance of a priestly caste.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Human Sacrifices in Ireland</hi>
</p>

<p>
Bertrand endeavours to dissociate the Druids from
these practices, of which he says strangely there is <q>no
trace</q> in Ireland, although there, as elsewhere in
Celtica, Druidism was all-powerful. There is little
doubt, however, that in Ireland also human sacrifices
at one time prevailed. In a very ancient tract, the
<q>Dinnsenchus,</q> preserved in the <q>Book of Leinster,</q> it
is stated that on Moyslaught, <q>the Plain of Adoration,</q>
there stood a great gold idol, Crom Cruach (the Bloody
Crescent). To it the Gaels used to sacrifice children
when praying for fair weather and fertility&mdash;<q>it was
milk and corn they asked from it in exchange for their
children&mdash;how great was their horror and their
moaning!</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>The Irish Mythological Cycle,</q> by d'Arbois de Jubainville,
p. 6l. The <q>Dinnsenchus</q> in question is an early Christian document.
No trace of a being like Crom Cruach has been found as yet in the
pagan literature of Ireland, nor in the writings of St. Patrick, and I
think it is quite probable that even in the time of St. Patrick human
sacrifices had become only a memory.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>And in Egypt</hi>
</p>

<p>
In Egypt, where the national character was markedly
easy-going, pleasure-loving, and little capable of fanatical
exaltation, we find no record of any such cruel rites in
the monumental inscriptions and paintings, copious as
is the information which they give us on all features of
the national life and religion.<note place='foot'><p>
A representation of human sacrifice has, however, lately been discovered
in a Temple of the Sun in the ancient Ethiopian capital, Meroë.
</p></note> Manetho, indeed, the
<pb n='86' id='page86'/>
Egyptian historian who wrote in the third century B.C.,
tells us that human sacrifices were abolished by Amasis I.
so late as the beginning of the XVIII Dynasty&mdash;about
1600 B.C. But the complete silence of the other
records shows us that even if we are to believe Manetho,
the practice must in historic times have been very rare,
and must have been looked on with repugnance.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Names of Celtic Deities</hi>
</p>

<p>
What were the names and the attributes of the
Celtic deities? Here we are very much in the dark.
The Megalithic People did not imagine their deities
under concrete personal form. Stones, rivers, wells,
trees, and other natural objects were to them the
adequate symbols, or were half symbols, half actual
embodiments, of the supernatural forces which they
venerated. But the imaginative mind of the Aryan
Celt was not content with this. The existence of personal
gods with distinct titles and attributes is reported
to us by Caesar, who equates them with various figures
in the Roman pantheon&mdash;Mercury, Apollo, Mars, and
so forth. Lucan mentions a triad of deities, Æsus,
Teutates, and Taranus<note place='foot'><p>
<q>You [Celts] who by cruel blood outpoured think to appease the
pitiless Teutates, the horrid Æsus with his barbarous altars, and
Taranus whose worship is no gentler than that of the Scythian Diana</q>,
to whom captive were offered up. (Lucan, <q>Pharsalia</q>, i. 444.)
An altar dedicated to Æsus has been discovered in Paris.
</p></note>; and it is noteworthy that in
these names we seem to be in presence of a true Celtic,
<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Aryan, tradition. Thus Æsus is derived by
Belloguet from the Aryan root <hi rend='italic'>as</hi>, meaning <q>to be</q>,
which furnished the name of Asura-masda (<hi rend='italic'>l'Esprit Sage</hi>)
to the Persians, Æsun to the Umbrians, Asa (Divine
Being) to the Scandinavians. Teutates comes from a
Celtic root meaning <q>valiant</q>, <q>warlike</q>, and indicates
<pb n='87' id='page87'/>
a deity equivalent to Mars. Taranus (? Thor), according
to de Jubainville, is a god of the Lightning (<hi rend='italic'>taran</hi> 
in Welsh, Cornish, and Breton is the word for
<q>thunderbolt</q>). Votive inscriptions to these gods
have been found in Gaul and Britain. Other inscriptions
and sculptures bear testimony to the existence in
Gaul of a host of minor and local deities who are
mostly mere names, or not even names, to us now. In
the form in which we have them these conceptions bear
clear traces of Roman influence. The sculptures are
rude copies of the Roman style of religious art. But
we meet among them figures of much wilder and
stranger aspect&mdash;gods with triple faces, gods with
branching antlers on their brows, ram-headed serpents,
and other now unintelligible symbols of the older faith.
Very notable is the frequent occurrence of the cross-legged 
<q>Buddha</q> attitude so prevalent in the religious
art of the East and of Mexico, and also the tendency,
so well known in Egypt, to group the gods in triads.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Caesar on the Celtic Deities</hi>
</p>

<p>
Caesar, who tries to fit the Gallic religion into the
framework of Roman mythology&mdash;which was exactly
what the Gauls themselves did after the conquest&mdash;says
they held Mercury to be the chief of the gods, and
looked upon him as the inventor of all the arts, as the
presiding deity of commerce, and as the guardian of
roads and guide of travellers. One may conjecture that
he was particularly, to the Gauls as to the Romans, the
guide of the dead, of travellers to the Other-world,
Many bronze statues to Mercury, of Gaulish origin,
still remain, the name being adopted by the Gauls, as
many place-names still testify<note place='foot'><p>
Mont Mercure, Merc&oelig;ur, Mercoirey, Montmartre (<hi rend='italic'>Mons Mercurii</hi>),
&amp;c.
</p></note>. Apollo was regarded
<pb n='88' id='page88'/>
as the deity of medicine and healing, Minerva was the
initiator of arts and crafts, Jupiter governed the sky,
and Mars presided over war. C&aelig;sar is here, no doubt,
classifying under five types and by Roman names a large
number of Gallic divinities.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The God of the Underworld</hi>
</p>

<p>
According to C&aelig;sar, a most notable deity of the
Gauls was (in Roman nomenclature) Dis, or Pluto, the
god of the Underworld inhabited by the dead. From
him all the Gauls claimed to be descended, and on this
account, says C&aelig;sar, they began their reckoning of the
twenty-four hours of the day with the oncoming of
night.<note place='foot'><p>
To this day in many parts of France the peasantry use terms
like <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>annuit, o'né, anneue</foreign>, &amp;c., all meaning <q>to-night,</q> for <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>aujourd'hui</foreign>
(Bertrand, <q>Rel. des G.,</q> p. 356).
</p></note> The name of this deity is not given. D'Arbois
de Jubainville considers that, together with Æsus,
Teutates, Taranus, and, in Irish mythology, Balor and
the Fomorians, he represents the powers of darkness,
death, and evil, and Celtic mythology is thus interpreted
as a variant of the universal solar myth, embodying the
conception of the eternal conflict between Day and Night.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The God of Light</hi>
</p>

<p>
The God of Light appears in Gaul and in Ireland as
Lugh, or Lugus, who has left his traces in many place-names
such as <hi rend='italic'>Lug-dunum</hi> (Leyden), Lyons, &amp;c. Lugh
appears in Irish legend with distinctly solar attributes.
When he meets his army before the great conflict with
the Fomorians, they feel, says the saga, as if they beheld
the rising of the sun. Yet he is also, as we shall see,
a god of the Underworld, belonging on the side of his
mother Ethlinn, daughter of Balor, to the Powers of
Darkness.
</p>

<pb n='89' id='page89'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Celtic Conception of Death</hi>
</p>

<p>
The fact is that the Celtic conception of the realm
of death differed altogether from that of the Greeks and
Romans, and, as I have already pointed out, resembled
that of Egyptian religion. The Other-world was not a
place of gloom and suffering, but of light and liberation.
The Sun was as much the god of that world as he was or
this. Evil, pain, and gloom there were, no doubt, and no
doubt these principles were embodied by the Irish Celts
in their myths of Balor and the Fomorians, of which
we shall hear anon; but that they were particularly
associated with the idea of death is, I think, a false
supposition founded on misleading analogies drawn
from the ideas of the classical nations. Here the Celts
followed North African or Asiatic conceptions rather
than those of the Aryans of Europe. It is only by
realising that the Celts as we know them in history,
from the break-up of the Mid-European Celtic empire
onwards, formed a singular blend of Aryan with non-Aryan
characteristics, that we shall arrive at a true
understanding of their contribution to European history
and their influence in European culture.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Five Factors in Ancient Celtic Culture</hi>
</p>

<p>
To sum up the conclusions indicated: we can, I
think, distinguish five distinct factors in the religious
and intellectual culture of Celtic lands as we find them
prior to the influx of classical or of Christian influences.
First, we have before us a mass of popular superstitions
and of magical observances, including human sacrifice.
These varied more or less from place to place, centring
as they did largely on local features which were regarded
as embodiments or vehicles of divine or of diabolic
power. Secondly, there was certainly in existence a
<pb n='90' id='page90'/>
thoughtful and philosophic creed, having as its central
object of worship the Sun, as an emblem of divine
power and constancy, and as its central doctrine the
immortality of the soul. Thirdly, there was a worship
of personified deities, Æsus, Teutates, Lugh, and others,
conceived as representing natural forces, or as guardians
of social laws. Fourthly, the Romans were deeply
impressed with the existence among the Druids of a
body of teaching of a quasi-scientific nature about
natural phenomena and the constitution of the universe,
of the details of which we unfortunately know practically
nothing. Lastly, we have to note the prevalence of a
sacerdotal organisation, which administered the whole
system of religious and of secular learning and literature,<note place='foot'><p>
The <hi rend='italic'>fili</hi>, or professional poets, it must be remembered, were a
branch of the Druidic order.
</p></note>
which carefully confined this learning to a privileged
caste, and which, by virtue of its intellectual supremacy
and of the atmosphere of religious awe with which it was
surrounded, became the sovran power, social, political,
and religious, in every Celtic country. I have spoken of
these elements as distinct, and we can, indeed, distinguish
them in thought, but in practice they were inextricably
intertwined, and the Druidic organisation pervaded and
ordered all. Can we now, it may be asked, distinguish
among them what is of Celtic and what of pre-Celtic
and probably non-Aryan origin? This is a more
difficult task; yet, looking at all the analogies and
probabilities, I think we shall not be far wrong in
assigning to the Megalithic People the special doctrines,
the ritual, and the sacerdotal organisation of Druidism,
and to the Celtic element the personified deities, with
the zest for learning and for speculation; while the
popular superstitions were merely the local form assumed
by conceptions as widespread as the human race.
</p>

<pb n='91' id='page91'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Celts of To-day</hi>
</p>

<p>
In view of the undeniably mixed character of the
populations called <q>Celtic</q> at the present day, it is
often urged that this designation has no real relation
to any ethnological fact. The Celts who fought with
Caesar in Gaul and with the English in Ireland are, it
is said, no more&mdash;they have perished on a thousand
battlefields from Alesia to the Boyne, and an older
racial stratum has come to the surface in their place.
The true Celts, according to this view, are only to be
found in the tall, ruddy Highlanders of Perthshire and
North-west Scotland, and in a few families of the old
ruling race still surviving in Ireland and in Wales. In
all this I think it must be admitted that there is a large
measure of truth. Yet it must not be forgotten that
the descendants of the Megalithic People at the present
day are, on the physical side, deeply impregnated with
Celtic blood, and on the spiritual with Celtic traditions
and ideals. Nor, again, in discussing these questions
of race-character and its origin, must it ever be assumed
that the character of a people can be analysed as one
analyses a chemical compound, fixing once for all its
constituent parts and determining its future behaviour
and destiny. Race-character, potent and enduring though
it be, is not a dead thing, cast in an iron mould, and thereafter
incapable of change and growth. It is part of the
living forces of the world; it is plastic and vital; it has
hidden potencies which a variety of causes, such as a felicitous
cross with a different, but not too different, stock, or&mdash;in
another sphere&mdash;the adoption of a new religious or
social ideal, may at any time unlock and bring into action.
</p>

<p>
Of one thing I personally feel convinced&mdash;that the
problem of the ethical, social, and intellectual development
of the people constituting what is called the
<pb n='92' id='page92'/>
<q>Celtic Fringe</q> in Europe ought to be worked for
on Celtic lines; by the maintenance of the Celtic
tradition, Celtic literature, Celtic speech&mdash;the encouragement,
in short, of all those Celtic affinities of which this
mixed race is now the sole conscious inheritor and
guardian. To these it will respond, by these it can be
deeply moved; nor has the harvest ever failed those
who with courage and faith have driven their plough
into this rich field. On the other hand, if this work is
to be done with success it must be done in no pedantic,
narrow, intolerant spirit; there must be no clinging to
the outward forms of the past simply because the Celtic
spirit once found utterance in them. Let it be remembered
that in the early Middle Ages Celts from Ireland
were the most notable explorers, the most notable
pioneers of religion, science, and speculative thought in
Europe.<note place='foot'><p>
For instance, Pelagius in the fifth century; Columba, Columbanus,
and St. Gall in the sixth; Fridolin, named <hi rend='italic'>Viator</hi>, <q>the
Traveller,</q> and Fursa in the seventh; Virgilius (Feargal) of Salzburg,
who had to answer at Rome for teaching the sphericity of the
earth, in the eighth; Dicuil, <q>the Geographer,</q> and Johannes Scotus
Erigena&mdash;the master mind of his epoch&mdash;in the ninth.
</p></note> Modern investigators have traced their footprints
of light over half the heathen continent, and the
schools of Ireland were thronged with foreign pupils who
could get learning nowhere else. The Celtic spirit was
then playing its true part in the world-drama, and a greater
it has never played. The legacy of these men should
be cherished indeed, but not as a museum curiosity;
nothing could be more opposed to their free, bold, adventurous
spirit than to let that legacy petrify in the hands
of those who claim the heirship or their name and fame.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Mythical Literature</hi>
</p>

<p>
After the sketch contained in this and the foregoing
chapter of the early history of the Celts, and of the forces
<pb n='93' id='page93'/>
which have moulded it, we shall now turn to give an
account of the mythical and legendary literature in which
their spirit most truly lives and shines. We shall not
here concern ourselves with any literature which is not
Celtic. With all that other peoples have made&mdash;as in
the Arthurian legends&mdash;of myths and tales originally
Celtic, we have here nothing to do. No one can now
tell how much is Celtic in them and how much is not.
And in matters of this kind it is generally the final
recasting that is of real importance and value. Whatever
we give, then, we give without addition or reshaping.
Stories, of course, have often to be summarised,
but there shall be nothing in them that did not come
direct from the Celtic mind, and that does not exist
to-day in some variety, Gaelic or Cymric, of the Celtic
tongue.

<head>CHAPTER III: THE IRISH INVASION
MYTHS</head>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Celtic Cosmogony</hi>
</p>

<p>
Among those secret doctrines about the <q>nature
of things</q> which, as C&aelig;sar tells us, the Druids
never would commit to writing, was there anything
in the nature of a cosmogony, any account of the
origin of the world and of man? There surely was. It
would be strange indeed if, alone among the races of
the world, the Celts had no world-myth. The spectacle
of the universe with all its vast and mysterious phenomena
in heaven and on earth has aroused, first the
imagination, afterwards the speculative reason, in every
people which is capable of either. The Celts had both
in abundance, yet, except for that one phrase about the
<q>indestructibility</q> of the world handed down to us by
Strabo, we know nothing of their early imaginings or
their reasonings on this subject. Ireland possesses a
copious legendary literature. All of this, no doubt,
assumed its present form in Christian times; yet so
much essential paganism has been allowed to remain in
it that it would be strange if Christian influences had led
to the excision of everything in these ancient texts that
pointed to a non-Christian conception of the origin of
things&mdash;if Christian editors and transmitters had never
given us even the least glimmer of the existence of such
a conception. Yet the fact is that they do not give it;
there is nothing in the most ancient legendary literature
of the Irish Gaels, which is the oldest Celtic literature
in existence, corresponding to the Babylonian conquest
of Chaos, or the wild Norse myth of the making of
Midgard out of the corpse of Ymir, or the Egyptian
creation of the universe out of the primeval Water by
Thoth, the Word of God, or even to the primitive folklore
<pb n='95' id='page95'/>
conceptions found in almost every savage tribe.
That the Druids had some doctrine on this subject it is
impossible to doubt. But, by resolutely confining it to
the initiated and forbidding all lay speculation on the
subject, they seem to have completely stifled the mythmaking
instinct in regard to questions of cosmogony
among the people at large, and ensured that when their
own order perished, their teaching, whatever it was,
should die with them.
</p>

<p>
In the early Irish accounts, therefore, of the beginnings
of things, we find that it is not with the World that
the narrators make their start&mdash;it is simply with their own
country, with Ireland. It was the practice, indeed, to
prefix to these narratives of early invasions and colonisations
the Scriptural account of the making of the
world and man, and this shows that something of the
kind was felt to be required; but what took the place
of the Biblical narrative in pre-Christian days we do
not know, and, unfortunately, are now never likely to
know.

<hi rend='bold'>The Cycles of Irish Legend</hi>
</p>

<p>
Irish mythical and legendary literature, as we have it
in the most ancient form, may be said to fall into four
main divisions, and to these we shall adhere in our
presentation of it in this volume. They are, in chronological
order, the Mythological Cycle, or Cycle of the
Invasions, the Ultonian or Conorian Cycle, the Ossianic
or Fenian Cycle, and a multitude of miscellaneous tales
and legends which it is hard to fit into any historical
framework.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Mythological Cycle</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Mythological Cycle comprises the following
sections:
</p>

<pb n='96' id='page96'/>

<lg>
<l>1. The coming of Partholan into Ireland.</l>
<l>2. The coming of Nemed into Ireland.</l>
<l>3. The coming of the Firbolgs into Ireland.</l>
<l>4. The invasion of the <hi rend='italic'>Tuatha De Danann</hi>, or People of the god Dana.</l>
<l>5. The invasion of the Milesians (Sons of Miled) from Spain, and their conquest of the People of Dana.</l>
</lg>

<p>
With the Milesians we begin to come into something
resembling history&mdash;they represent, in Irish legend, the
Celtic race; and from them the ruling families of Ireland
are supposed to be descended. The People of
Dana are evidently gods. The pre-Danaan settlers or
invaders are huge phantom-like figures, which loom
vaguely through the mists of tradition, and have little
definite characterisation. The accounts which are given
of them are many and conflicting, and out of these we
can only give here the more ancient narratives.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Coming of Partholan</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Celts, as we have learned from Caesar, believed
themselves to be descended from the God of the Underworld,
the God of the Dead. Partholan is said to have
come into Ireland from the West, where beyond the
vast, unsailed Atlantic Ocean the Irish Fairyland, the
Land of the Living&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the land of the Happy Dead&mdash;
was placed. His father's name was Sera (? the West).
He came with his queen Dalny<note place='foot'><p>
Dealgnaid. I have been obliged here, as occasionally elsewhere,
to modify the Irish names so as to make them pronounceable by
English readers.
</p></note> and a number of companions
of both sexes. Ireland&mdash;and this is an imaginative
touch intended to suggest extreme antiquity&mdash;was
then a different country, physically, from what it is now.
There were then but three lakes in Ireland, nine rivers,
and only one plain. Others were added gradually
<pb n='97' id='page97'/>
during the reign of the Partholanians. One, Lake
Rury, was said to have burst out as a grave was being
dug for Rury, son of Partholan.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Fomorians</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Partholanians, it is said, had to do battle with a
strange race, called the Fomorians, of whom we shall
hear much in later sections of this book. They were a
huge, misshapen, violent and cruel people, representing,
we may believe, the powers of evil. One of these was
surnamed <hi rend='italic'>Cenchos</hi>, which means The Footless, and thus
appears to be related to Vitra, the God of Evil in Vedantic
mythology, who had neither feet nor hands. With a
host of these demons Partholan fought for the lordship
of Ireland, and drove them out to the northern seas,
whence they occasionally harried the country under its
later rulers.
</p>

<p>
The end of the race of Partholan was that they were
afflicted by pestilence, and having gathered together on
the Old Plain (Senmag) for convenience of burying
their dead, they all perished there; and Ireland once
more lay empty for reoccupation.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Legend of Tuan mac Carell</hi>
</p>

<p>
Who, then, told the tale? This brings us to the
mention of a very curious and interesting legend&mdash;one
of the numerous legendary narratives in which these
tales of the Mythical Period have come down to us.
It is found in the so-called <q>Book of the Dun Cow,</q> a
manuscript of about the year A.D. 1100, and is entitled
<q>The Legend of Tuan mac Carell.</q>
</p>

<p>
St. Finnen, an Irish abbot of the sixth century, is
said to have gone to seek hospitality from a chief named
Tuan mac Carell, who dwelt not far from Finnen's
monastery at Moville, Co. Donegal. Tuan refused
<pb n='98' id='page98'/>
him admittance. The saint sat down on the doorstep
of the chief and fasted for a whole Sunday,<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='p48_n1'>p. 48, <hi rend='italic'>note</hi> 1</ref>.
</p></note> upon which
the surly pagan warrior opened the door to him.
Good relations were established between them, and the
saint returned to his monks.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tuan is an excellent man,</q> said he to them; <q>he
will come to you and comfort you, and tell you the old
stories of Ireland.</q><note place='foot'><p>
I follow in this narrative R.I. Best's translation of the <q>Irish
Mythological Cycle</q> of d'Arbois de Jubainville.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
This humane interest in the old myths and legends
of the country is, it may here be observed, a feature as
constant as it is pleasant in the literature of early Irish
Christianity.
</p>

<p>
Tuan came shortly afterwards to return the visit of
the saint, and invited him and his disciples to his
fortress. They asked him of his name and lineage, and
he gave an astounding reply. <q>I am a man of Ulster,</q>
he said. <q>My name is Tuan son of Carell. But once
I was called Tuan son of Starn, son of Sera, and my
father, Starn, was the brother of Partholan.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell us the history of Ireland,</q> then said Finnen,
and Tuan began. Partholan, he said, was the first of
men to settle in Ireland. After the great pestilence
already narrated he alone survived, <q>for there is never
a slaughter that one man does not come out of it to tell
the tale.</q> Tuan was alone in the land, and he wandered
about from one vacant fortress to another, from
rock to rock, seeking shelter from the wolves. For
twenty-two years he lived thus alone, dwelling in waste
places, till at last he fell into extreme decrepitude and
old age.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>Then Nemed son of Agnoman took possession of
Ireland. He [Agnoman] was my father's brother. I
<pb n='99' id='page99'/>
saw him from the cliffs, and kept avoiding him. I was
long-haired, clawed, decrepit, grey, naked, wretched,
miserable. Then one evening I fell asleep, and when
I woke again on the morrow I was changed into a stag.
I was young again and glad of heart. Then I sang of
the coming of Nemed and of his race, and of my own
transformation.... <q>I have put on a new form, a
skin rough and grey. Victory and joy are easy to me;
a little while ago I was weak and defenceless.</q></q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
Tuan is then king of all the deer of Ireland, and so
remained all the days of Nemed and his race.
</p>

<p>
He tells how the Nemedians sailed for Ireland in a
fleet of thirty-two barks, in each bark thirty persons.
They went astray on the seas for a year and a half, and
most of them perished of hunger and thirst or of shipwreck.
Nine only escaped&mdash;Nemed himself, with four
men and four women. These landed in Ireland, and
increased their numbers in the course of time till
they were 8060 men and women. Then all of them
mysteriously died.
</p>

<p>
Again old age and decrepitude fell upon Tuan, but
another transformation awaited him. <q rend='post: none'>Once I was
standing at the mouth of my cave&mdash;I still remember it
&mdash;and I knew that my body changed into another form.
I was a wild boar. And I sang this song about it:</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q rend='post: none'><q>To-day I am a boar.... Time was when I sat in the
assembly that gave the judgments of Partholan. It was
sung, and all praised the melody. How pleasant was the
strain of my brilliant judgment! How pleasant to the
comely young women! My chariot went along in majesty
and beauty. My voice was grave and sweet. My step
was swift and firm in battle. My face was full of charm.
To-day, lo! I am changed into a black boar.</q></q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is what I said. Yea, of a surety I was a wild
boar. Then I became young again, and I was glad. I
<pb n='100' id='page100'/>
was king of the boar-herds in Ireland; and, faithful to
any custom, I went the rounds of my abode when I
returned into the lands of Ulster, at the times old age
and wretchedness came upon me. For it was always
there that my transformations took place, and that is
why I went back thither to await the renewal of my body.</q>
</p>

<p>
Tuan then goes on to tell how Semion son of
Stariat settled in Ireland, from whom descended the
Firbolgs and two other tribes who persisted into
historic times. Again old age comes on, his strength
fails him, and he undergoes another transformation; he
becomes <q>a great eagle of the sea,</q> and once more
rejoices in renewed youth and vigour. He then tells
how the People of Dana came in, <q>gods and false gods
from whom every one knows the Irish men of learning
are sprung.</q> After these came the Sons of Miled, who
conquered the People of Dana. All this time Tuan
kept the shape of the sea-eagle, till one day, finding
himself about to undergo another transformation, he
fasted nine days; <q>then sleep fell upon me, and I was
changed into a salmon.</q> He rejoices in his new life,
escaping for many years the snares of the fishermen,
till at last he is captured by one of them and brought
to the wife of Carell, chief of the country. <q>The
woman desired me and ate me by herself, whole, so
that I passed into her womb.</q> He is born again, and
passes for Tuan son of Carell; but the memory of his
pre-existence and all his transformations and all the
history of Ireland that he witnessed since the days of
Partholan still abides with him, and he teaches all these
things to the Christian monks, who carefully preserve
them.
</p>

<p>
This wild tale, with its atmosphere of grey antiquity
and of childlike wonder, reminds us of the transformations
of the Welsh Taliessin, who also became an eagle,
<pb n='101' id='page101'/>
and points to that doctrine of the transmigration of the
soul which, as we have seen, haunted the imagination
of the Celt.
</p>

<p>
We have now to add some details to the sketch of
the successive colonisations of Ireland outlined by Tuan
mac Carell.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Nemedians</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Nemedians, as we have seen, were akin to the
Partholanians. Both of them came from the mysterious
regions of the dead, though later Irish accounts, which
endeavoured to reconcile this mythical matter with
Christianity, invented for them a descent from Scriptural
patriarchs and an origin in earthly lands such as Spain or
Scythia. Both of them had to do constant battle with
the Fomorians, whom the later legends make out to be
pirates from oversea, but who are doubtless divinities
representing the powers of darkness and evil. There
is no legend of the Fomorians coming into Ireland, nor
were they regarded as at any time a regular portion of
the population. They were coeval with the world itself.
Nemed fought victoriously against them in four great
battles, but shortly afterwards died of a plague which
carried off 2000 of his people with him. The
Fomorians were then enabled to establish their tyranny
over Ireland. They had at this period two kings,
Morc and Conann. The stronghold of the Formorian
power was on Tory Island, which uplifts its wild cliffs
and precipices in the Atlantic off the coast of Donegal&mdash;a
fit home for this race of mystery and horror. They
extracted a crushing tribute from the people of Ireland,
two-thirds of all the milk and two-thirds of the children
of the land. At last the Nemedians rise in revolt.
Led by three chiefs, they land on Tory Island, capture
Conann's Tower, and Conann himself falls by the
<pb n='102' id='page102'/>
hand of the Nemedian chief, Fergus. But Morc at
this moment comes into the battle with a fresh host,
and utterly routs the Nemedians, who are all slain but
thirty:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>The men of Erin were all at the battle,</q></l>
<l>After the Fomorians came;</l>
<l>All of them the sea engulphed,</l>
<l><q rend='pre: none'>Save only three times ten.</q></l>
<l rend='text-align: right'><hi rend='italic'>Poem by Eochy O'Flann, circ</hi>. A.D. 960.</l>
</lg>

<p>
The thirty survivors leave Ireland in despair.
According to the most ancient belief they perished
utterly, leaving no descendants, but later accounts,
which endeavour to make sober history out of all these
myths, represent one family, that of the chief Britan,
as settling in Great Britain and giving their name to
that country, while two others returned to Ireland, after
many wanderings, as the Firbolgs and People of Dana.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Coming of the Firbolgs</hi>
</p>

<p>
Who were the Firbolgs, and what did they represent
in Irish legend? The name appears to mean <q>Men of
the Bags,</q> and a legend was in later times invented to
account for it. It was said that after settling in Greece
they were oppressed by the people of that country,
who set them to carry earth from the fertile valleys up
to the rocky hills, so as to make arable ground of the
latter. They did their task by means of leathern bags;
but at last, growing weary of the oppression, they made
boats or coracles out of their bags, and set sail in them for
Ireland. Nennius, however, says they came from Spain,
for according to him all the various races that inhabited
Ireland came originally from Spain; and <q>Spain</q>
with him is a rationalistic rendering of the Celtic words
designating the Land of the Dead.<note place='foot'><p>
De Jubainville, <q>Irish Mythological Cycle,</q> p. 75.
</p></note> They came in three
<pb n='103' id='page103'/>
groups, the Fir-Bolg, the Fir-Domnan, and the Galioin,
who are all generally designated as Firbolgs. They
play no great part in Irish mythical history, and a certain
character of servility and inferiority appears to attach to
them throughout.
</p>

<p>
One of their kings, Eochy<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Yeo´hee.</q> See Glossary for this and other words.
</p></note> mac Erc, took in marriage
Taltiu, or Telta, daughter of the King of the <q>Great
Plain</q> (the Land of the Dead). Telta had a palace at the
place now called after her, Telltown (properly Teltin).
There she died, and there, even in medi&aelig;val Ireland,
a great annual assembly or fair was held in her honour.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Coming of the People of Dana</hi>
</p>

<p>
We now come to by far the most interesting and
important of the mythical invaders and colonisers of
Ireland, the People of Dana. The name, <hi rend='italic'>Tuatha De
Danann</hi>, means literally <q>the folk of the god whose
mother is Dana.</q> Dana also sometimes bears another
name, that of Brigit, a goddess held in much honour
by pagan Ireland, whose attributes are in a great
measure transferred in legend to the Christian St.
Brigit of the sixth century. Her name is also found
in Gaulish inscriptions as <q>Brigindo,</q> and occurs in
several British inscriptions as <q>Brigantia.</q> She was the
daughter of the supreme head of the People of Dana,
the god Dagda, <q>The Good.</q> She had three sons, who
are said to have had in common one only son, named
Ecne&mdash;that is to say, <q>Knowledge,</q> or <q>Poetry.</q><note place='foot'><p>
The science of the Druids, as we have seen, was conveyed in
verse, and the professional poets were a branch of the Druidic
Order.
</p></note>
Ecne, then, may be said to be the god whose mother
was Dana, and the race to whom she gave her name are
the clearest representatives we have in Irish myths of
<pb n='104' id='page104'/>
the powers of Light and Knowledge. It will be remembered
that alone among all these mythical races
Tuan mac Carell gave to the People of Dana the name
of <q>gods.</q> Yet it is not as gods that they appear in
the form in which Irish legends about them have now
come down to us. Christian influences reduced them
to the rank of fairies or identified them with the fallen
angels. They were conquered by the Milesians, who
are conceived as an entirely human race, and who had
all sorts of relations of love and war with them until
quite recent times. Yet even in the later legends a
certain splendour and exaltation appears to invest the
People of Dana, recalling the high estate from which
they had been dethroned.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Popular and the Bardic Conceptions</hi>
</p>

<p>
Nor must it be overlooked that the popular conception
of the Danaan deities was probably at all times
something different from the bardic and Druidic, or in
other words the scholarly, conception. The latter, as
we shall see, represents them as the presiding deities of
science and poetry. This is not a popular idea; it is
the product of the Celtic, the Aryan imagination, inspired
by a strictly intellectual conception. The common
people, who represented mainly the Megalithic element
in the population, appear to have conceived their deities
as earth-powers&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>dei terreni</hi>, as they are explicitly called
in the eighth-century <q>Book of Armagh</q><note place='foot'><p>
Meyer and Nutt, <q>Voyage of Bran,</q> ii. 197.
</p></note>&mdash;presiding,
not over science and poetry, but rather agriculture,
controlling the fecundity of the earth and water, and
dwelling in hills, rivers, and lakes. In the bardic
literature the Aryan idea is prominent; the other is to
be found in innumerable folk-tales and popular observances;
but of course in each case a considerable amount
<pb n='105' id='page105'/>
of interpenetration of the two conceptions is to be met
with&mdash;no sharp dividing line was drawn between them
in ancient times, and none can be drawn now.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Treasures of the Danaans</hi>
</p>

<p>
Tuan mac Carell says they came to Ireland <q>out of
heaven.</q> This is embroidered in later tradition into a
narrative telling how they sprang from four great cities,
whose very names breathe of fairydom and romance&mdash;Falias,
Gorias, Finias, and Murias. Here they learned
science and craftsmanship from great sages one of whom
was enthroned in each city, and from each they brought
with them a magical treasure. From Falias came
the stone called the <hi rend='italic'>Lia Fail</hi>, or Stone of Destiny, on
which the High-Kings of Ireland stood when they were
crowned, and which was supposed to confirm the election
of a rightful monarch by roaring under him as he took
his place on it. The actual stone which was so used at
the inauguration of a reign did from immemorial times
exist at Tara, and was sent thence to Scotland early in
the sixth century for the crowning of Fergus the Great,
son of Erc, who begged his brother Murtagh mac Erc,
King of Ireland, for the loan of it. An ancient prophecy
told that wherever this stone was, a king of the
Scotic (<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Irish-Milesian) race should reign. This is
the famous Stone of Scone, which never came back to
Ireland, but was removed to England by Edward I. in
1297, and is now the Coronation Stone in Westminster
Abbey. Nor has the old prophecy been falsified, since
through the Stuarts and Fergus mac Erc the descent
of the British royal family can be traced from the
historic kings of Milesian Ireland.
</p>

<p>
The second treasure of the Danaans was the invincible
sword of Lugh of the Long Arm, of whom we
shall hear later, and this sword came from the city of
<pb n='106' id='page106'/>
Gorias. From Finias came a magic spear, and from
Murias the Cauldron of the Dagda, a vessel which had
the property that it could feed a host of men without
ever being emptied.
</p>

<p>
With these possessions, according to the version given
in the <q>Book of Invasions,</q> the People of Dana came
into Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Danaans and the Firbolgs</hi>
</p>

<p>
They were wafted into the land in a magic cloud,
making their first appearance in Western Connacht.
When the cloud cleared away, the Firbolgs discovered
them in a camp which they had already fortified at
Moyrein.
</p>

<p>
The Firbolgs now sent out one of their warriors,
named Sreng, to interview the mysterious new-comers;
and the People of Dana, on their side, sent a warrior
named Bres to represent them. The two ambassadors
examined each other's weapons with great interest. The
spears of the Danaans, we are told, were light and
sharp-pointed; those of the Firbolgs were heavy and
blunt. To contrast the power of science with that of
brute force is here the evident intention of the legend,
and we are reminded of the Greek myth of the struggle
of the Olympian deities with the Titans.
</p>

<p>
Bres proposed to the Firbolg that the two races should
divide Ireland equally between them, and join to defend it
against all comers for the future. They then exchanged
weapons and returned each to his own camp.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The First Battle of Moytura</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Firbolgs, however, were not impressed with the
superiority of the Danaans, and decided to refuse their
offer. The battle was joined on the Plain of Moytura,<note place='foot'><p>
<q>Moytura</q> means <q>The Plain of the Towers</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, sepulchral
monuments.
</p></note>
<pb n='107' id='page107'/>
in the south of Co. Mayo, near the spot now called
Cong. The Firbolgs were led by their king, mac Erc,
and the Danaans by Nuada of the Silver Hand, who
got his name from an incident in this battle. His hand,
it is said, was cut off in the fight, and one of the skilful
artificers who abounded in the ranks of the Danaans
made him a new one of silver. By their magical and
healing arts the Danaans gained the victory, and the
Firbolg king was slain. But a reasonable agreement
followed: the Firbolgs were allotted the province of
Connacht for their territory, while the Danaans took the
rest of Ireland. So late as the seventeenth century the
annalist Mac Firbis discovered that many of the inhabitants
of Connacht traced their descent to these same
Firbolgs. Probably they were a veritable historic race,
and the conflict between them and the People of Dana
may be a piece of actual history invested with some of
the features of a myth.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Expulsion of King Bres</hi>
</p>

<p>
Nuada of the Silver Hand should now have been
ruler of the Danaans, but his mutilation forbade it, for
no blemished man might be a king in Ireland. The
Danaans therefore chose Bres, who was the son of a
Danaan woman named Eri, but whose father was unknown,
to reign over them instead. This was another
Bres, not the envoy who had treated with the Firbolgs
and who was slain in the battle of Moytura. Now Bres,
although strong and beautiful to look on, had no gift of
kingship, for he not only allowed the enemy of Ireland,
the Fomorians, to renew their oppression and taxation
in the land, but he himself taxed his subjects heavily
too; and was so niggardly that he gave no hospitality
to chiefs and nobles and harpers. Lack of generosity
and hospitality was always reckoned the worst of vices
<pb n='108' id='page108'/>
in an Irish prince. One day it is said that there came
to his court the poet Corpry, who found himself housed
in a small, dark chamber without fire or furniture, where,
after long delay, he was served with three dry cakes and
no ale. In revenge he composed a satirical quatrain on
his churlish host:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Without food quickly served,</q></l>
<l>Without a cow's milk, whereon a calf can grow,</l>
<l>Without a dwelling fit for a man under the gloomy night,</l>
<l>Without means to entertain a bardic company,&mdash;</l>
<l><q rend='pre: none'>Let such be the condition of Bres.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Poetic satire in Ireland was supposed to have a kind
of magical power. Kings dreaded it; even rats could
be exterminated by it.<note place='foot'><p>
Shakespeare alludes to this in <q>As You Like It.</q> <q>I never
was so be-rhymed,</q> says Rosalind, <q>since Pythagoras' time, that I
was an Irish rat&mdash;which I can hardly remember.</q>
</p></note> This quatrain of Corpry's was
repeated with delight among the people, and Bres had
to lay down his sovranty. This was said to be the
first satire ever made in Ireland. Meantime, because
Nuada had got his silver hand through the art of his
physician Diancecht, or because, as some versions of
the legend say, a still greater healer, the son of
Diancecht, had made the veritable hand grow again
to the stump, he was chosen to be king in place of
Bres.
</p>

<p>
The latter now betook himself in wrath and resentment
to his mother Eri, and begged her to give him
counsel and to tell him of his lineage. Eri then
declared to him that his father was Elatha, a king of
the Fomorians, who had come to her secretly from
over sea, and when he departed had given her a ring,
bidding her never bestow it on any man save him
whose finger it would fit. She now brought forth
the ring, and it fitted the finger of Bres, who went
<pb n='109' id='page109'/>
down with her to the strand where the Fomorian lover
had landed, and they sailed together for his father's
home.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tyranny of the Fomorians</hi>
</p>

<p>
Elatha recognised the ring, and gave his son an
army wherewith to reconquer Ireland, and also sent
him to seek further aid from the greatest of the
Fomorian kings, Balor. Now Balor was surnamed
<q>of the Evil Eye,</q> because the gaze of his one eye
could slay like a thunderbolt those on whom he looked
in anger. He was now, however, so old and feeble
that the vast eyelid drooped over the death-dealing eye,
and had to be lifted up by his men with ropes and
pulleys when the time came to turn it on his foes.
Nuada could make no more head against him than
Bres had done when king; and the country still groaned
under the oppression of the Fomorians and longed for
a champion and redeemer.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Coming of Lugh</hi>
</p>

<p>
A new figure now comes into the myth, no other
than Lugh son of Kian, the Sun-god <hi rend='italic'>par excellence</hi>
of all Celtica, whose name we can still identify in many
historic sites on the Continent.<note place='foot'><p>
Lyons, Leyden, Laon were all in ancient times known as
<hi rend='italic'>Lug-dunum,</hi> the Fortress of Lugh. <hi rend='italic'>Luguvallum</hi> was the name of a
town near Hadrian's Wall in Roman Britain.
</p></note> To explain his appearance
we must desert for a moment the ancient manuscript
authorities, which are here incomplete, and have to
be supplemented by a folk-tale which was fortunately
discovered and taken down orally so late as the nineteenth
century by the great Irish antiquary, O'Donovan.<note place='foot'><p>
It is given by him in a note to the <q>Four Masters,</q> vol. i.
p. 18, and is also reproduced by de Jubainville.
</p></note>
<pb n='110' id='page110'/>
In this folk-tale the names of Balor and his daughter
Ethlinn (the latter in the form <q>Ethnea</q>) are
preserved, as well as those of some other mythical
personages, but that of the father of Lugh is faintly
echoed in MacKineely; Lugh's own name is forgotten,
and the death of Balor is given in a manner inconsistent
with the ancient myth. In the story as I give
it here the antique names and mythical outline are
preserved, but are supplemented where required from
the folk-tale, omitting from the latter those modern
features which are not reconcilable with the myth.
</p>

<p>
The story, then, goes that Balor, the Fomorian king,
heard in a Druidic prophecy that he would be slain by
his grandson. His only child was an infant daughter
named Ethlinn. To avert the doom he, like Acrisios,
father of Danae, in the Greek myth, had her imprisoned
in a high tower which he caused to be built on a
precipitous headland, the Tor Mōr, in Tory Island.
He placed the girl in charge of twelve matrons, who
were strictly charged to prevent her from ever seeing
the face of man, or even learning that there were any
beings of a different sex from her own. In this
seclusion Ethlinn grew up&mdash;as all sequestered princesses
do&mdash;into a maiden of surpassing beauty.
</p>

<p>
Now it happened that there were on the mainland
three brothers, namely, Kian, Sawan, and Goban the
Smith, the great armourer and artificer of Irish myth,
who corresponds to Wayland Smith in Germanic
legend. Kian had a magical cow, whose milk was so
abundant that every one longed to possess her, and he
had to keep her strictly under protection.
</p>

<p>
Balor determined to possess himself of this cow.
One day Kian and Sawan had come to the forge to
have some weapons made for them, bringing fine steel
for that purpose. Kian went into the forge, leaving
<pb n='111' id='page111'/>
Sawan in charge of the cow. Balor now appeared on
the scene, taking on himself the form of a little redheaded
boy, and told Sawan that he had overheard the
brothers inside the forge concocting a plan for using all
the fine steel for their own swords, leaving but common
metal for that of Sawan. The latter, in a great rage,
gave the cow's halter to the boy and rushed into the
forge to put a stop to this nefarious scheme. Balor
immediately carried off the cow, and dragged her across
the sea to Tory Island.
</p>

<p>
Kian now determined to avenge himself on Balor,
and to this end sought the advice of a Druidess named
Birōg. Dressing himself in woman's garb, he was
wafted by magical spells across the sea, where Birōg, who
accompanied him, represented to Ethlinn's guardians
that they were two noble ladies cast upon the shore
in escaping from an abductor, and begged for shelter.
They were admitted; Kian found means to have access
to the Princess Ethlinn while the matrons were laid by
Birōg under the spell of an enchanted slumber, and
when they awoke Kian and the Druidess had vanished
as they came. But Ethlinn had given Kian her love,
and soon her guardians found that she was with child.
Fearing Balor's wrath, the matrons persuaded her that
the whole transaction was but a dream, and said nothing
about it; but in due time Ethlinn was delivered of
three sons at a birth.
</p>

<p>
News of this event came to Balor, and in anger and
fear he commanded the three infants to be drowned in
a whirlpool off the Irish coast. The messenger who
was charged with this command rolled up the children
in a sheet, but in carrying them to the appointed place
the pin of the sheet came loose, and one of the children
dropped out and fell into a little bay, called to this day
<hi rend='italic'>Port na Delig</hi>, or the Haven of the Pin. The other two
<pb n='112' id='page112'/>
were duly drowned, and the servant reported his
mission accomplished.
</p>

<p>
But the child who had fallen into the bay was
guarded by the Druidess, who wafted it to the home
of its father, Kian, and Kian gave it in fosterage to his
brother the smith, who taught the child his own trade
and made it skilled in every manner of craft and handiwork.
This child was Lugh. When he was grown to
a youth the Danaans placed him in charge of Duach,
<q>The Dark,</q> king of the Great Plain (Fairyland, or the
<q>Land of the Living,</q> which is also the Land of the
Dead), and here he dwelt till he reached manhood.
</p>

<p>
Lugh was, of course, the appointed redeemer of the
Danaan people from their servitude. His coming is
narrated in a story which brings out the solar attributes
of universal power, and shows him, like Apollo, as the
presiding deity of all human knowledge and of all
artistic and medicinal skill. He came, it is told, to
take service with Nuada of the Silver Hand, and when
the doorkeeper at the royal palace of Tara asked him
what he could do, he answered that he was a carpenter.
</p>

<p>
<q>We are in no need of a carpenter,</q> said the doorkeeper;
<q>we have an excellent one in Luchta son of
Luchad.</q> <q>I am a smith too,</q> said Lugh. <q>We
have a master-smith,</q> said the doorkeeper, <q>already.</q>
<q>Then I am a warrior,</q> said Lugh. <q>We do not
need one,</q> said the doorkeeper, <q>while we have
Ogma.</q> Lugh goes on to name all the occupations
and arts he can think of&mdash;he is a poet, a harper, a man
of science, a physician, a spencer, and so forth, always
receiving the answer that a man of supreme accomplishment
in that art is already installed at the court of
Nuada. <q>Then ask the King,</q> said Lugh, <q>if he has
in his service any one man who is accomplished in every
one of these arts, and if he have, I shall stay here no
<pb n='113' id='page113'/>
longer, nor seek to enter his palace.</q> Upon this Lugh
is received, and the surname Ildánach is conferred upon
him, meaning <q>The All-Craftsman,</q> Prince of all the
Sciences; while another name that he commonly bore
was Lugh Lamfada, or Lugh of the Long Arm. We
are reminded here, as de Jubainville points out, of the
Gaulish god whom Caesar identifies with Mercury,
<q>inventor of all the arts,</q> and to whom the Gauls put
up many statues. The Irish myth supplements this
information and tells us the Celtic name of this deity.
</p>

<p>
When Lugh came from the Land of the Living he
brought with him many magical gifts. There was the
Boat of Mananan, son of Lir the Sea God, which knew
a man's thoughts and would travel whithersoever he
would, and the Horse of Mananan, that could go alike
over land and sea, and a terrible sword named <hi rend='italic'>Fragarach</hi> 
(<q>The Answerer</q>), that could cut through any mail.
So equipped, he appeared one day before an assembly
of the Danaan chiefs who were met to pay their tribute
to the envoys of the Fomorian oppressors; and when
the Danaans saw him, they felt, it is said, as if they
beheld the rising of the sun on a dry summer's day.
Instead of paying the tribute, they, under Lugh's
leadership, attacked the Fomorians, all of whom were
slain but nine men, and these were sent back to tell Balor
that the Danaans defied him and would pay no tribute
henceforward. Balor then made him ready for battle,
and bade his captains, when they had subdued the
Danaans, make fast the island by cables to their ships
and tow it far northward to the Fomorian regions of
ice and gloom, where it would trouble them no longer.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Quest of the Sons of Turenn</hi>
</p>

<p>
Lugh, on his side, also prepared for the final combat;
but to ensure victory certain magical instruments were
<pb n='114' id='page114'/>
still needed for him, and these had now to be obtained.
The story of the quest of these objects, which incidentally
tells us also of the end of Lugh's father, Kian,
is one of the most valuable and curious in Irish legend,
and formed one of a triad of mythical tales which were
reckoned as the flower of Irish romance.<note place='foot'><p>
The other two were <q>The Fate of the Children of Lir</q> and
<q>The Fate of the Sons of Usna.</q> The stories of the Quest of the Sons
of Turenn and that of the Children of Lir have been told in full by
the author in his <q>High Deeds of Finn and other Bardic Romances,</q>
and that of the <q>Sons of Usna</q> (the Deirdre Legend) by Miss
Eleanor Hull in her <q>Cuchulain,</q> both published by Harrap and Co
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Kian, the story goes, was sent northward by Lugh to
summon the fighting men of the Danaans in Ulster to
the hosting against the Fomorians. On his way, as he
crosses the Plain of Murthemney, near Dundalk, he
meets with three brothers, Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharba,
sons of Turenn, between whose house and that of Kian
there was a blood-feud. He seeks to avoid them by
changing into the form of a pig and joining a herd
which is rooting in the plain, but the brothers detect
him and Brian wounds him with a cast from a spear.
Kian, knowing that his end is come, begs to be allowed
to change back into human form before he is slain.
<q>I had liefer kill a man than a pig,</q> says Brian, who
takes throughout the leading part in all the brothers'
adventures. Kian then stands before them as a man,
with the blood from Brian's spear trickling from his
breast. <q>I have outwitted ye,</q> he cries, <q>for if ye
had slain a pig ye would have paid but the eric [blood-fine]
of a pig, but now ye shall pay the eric of a man;
never was greater eric than that which ye shall pay;
and the weapons ye slay me with shall tell the tale to
the avenger of blood.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then you shall be slain with no weapons at all,</q>
<pb n='115' id='page115'/>
says Brian, and he and the brothers stone him to death
and bury him in the ground as deep as the height of a
man.
</p>

<p>
But when Lugh shortly afterwards passes that way
the stones on the plain cry out and tell him of his
father's murder at the hands of the sons of Turenn.
He uncovers the body, and, vowing vengeance, returns
to Tara. Here he accuses the sons of Turenn before
the High King, and is permitted to have them executed,
or to name the eric he will accept in remission of that
sentence. Lugh chooses to have the eric, and he names
it as follows, concealing things of vast price, and involving
unheard-of toils, under the names of common
objects: Three apples, the skin of a pig, a spear, a
chariot with two horses, seven swine, a hound, a
cooking-spit, and, finally, to give three shouts on a hill.
The brothers bind themselves to pay the fine, and
Lugh then declares the meaning of it. The three
apples are those which grow in the Garden of the Sun;
the pig-skin is a magical skin which heals every wound
and sickness if it can be laid on the sufferer, and it is a
possession of the King of Greece; the spear is a magical
weapon owned by the King of Persia (these names, of
course, are mere fanciful appellations for places in the
mysterious world of Faëry); the seven swine belong to
King Asal of the Golden Pillars, and may be killed and
eaten every night and yet be found whole next day;
the spit belongs to the sea-nymphs of the sunken Island
of Finchory; and the three shouts are to be given on
the hill of a fierce warrior, Mochaen, who, with his sons,
are under vows to prevent any man from raising his
voice on that hill. To fulfil any one of these enterprises
would be an all but impossible task, and the brothers
must accomplish them all before they can clear themselves
of the guilt and penalty of Kian's death.
</p>

<pb n='116' id='page116'/>

<p>
The story then goes on to tell how with infinite
daring and resource the sons of Turenn accomplish one
by one all their tasks, but when all are done save the
capture of the cooking-spit and the three shouts on the
Hill of Mochaen, Lugh, by magical arts, causes forgetfulness
to fall upon them, and they return to Ireland
with their treasures. These, especially the spear and
the pig-skin, are just what Lugh needs to help him
against the Fomorians; but his vengeance is not complete,
and after receiving the treasures he reminds the
brothers of what is yet to be won. They, in deep
dejection, now begin to understand how they are played
with, and go forth sadly to win, if they can, the rest of
the eric. After long wandering they discover that the
Island of Finchory is not above, but under the sea.
Brian in a magical <q>water-dress</q> goes down to it, sees
the thrice fifty nymphs in their palace, and seizes the
golden spit from their hearth. The ordeal of the Hill
of Mochaen is the last to be attempted. After a
desperate combat which ends in the slaying of Mochaen
and his sons, the brothers, mortally wounded, uplift
their voices in three faint cries, and so the eric is
fulfilled. The life is still in them, however, when they
return to Ireland, and their aged father, Turenn, implores
Lugh for the loan of the magic pig-skin to heal them;
but the implacable Lugh refuses, and the brothers and
their father die together. So ends the tale.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Second Battle of Moytura</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Second Battle of Moytura took place on a plain
in the north of Co. Sligo, which is remarkable for the
number of sepulchral monuments still scattered over it.
The first battle, of course, was that which the Danaans
had waged with the Firbolgs, and the Moytura there
referred to was much further south, in Co. Mayo.
<pb n='117' id='page117'/>
The battle with the Fomorians is related with an
astounding wealth of marvellous incident. The craftsmen
of the Danaans, Goban the smith, Credné the
artificer (or goldsmith), and Luchta the carpenter, keep
repairing the broken weapons of the Danaans with
magical speed&mdash;three blows of Goban's hammer make
a spear or sword, Luchta flings a handle at it and it
sticks on at once, and Credné jerks the rivets at it with
his tongs as fast as he makes them and they fly into
their places. The wounded are healed by the magical
pig-skin. The plain resounds with the clamour of
battle:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>Fearful indeed was the thunder which rolled over
the battlefield; the shouts of the warriors, the breaking
of the shields, the flashing and clashing of the swords,
of the straight, ivory-hilted swords, the music and
harmony of the <q>belly-darts</q> and the sighing and
winging of the spears and lances.</q><note place='foot'><p>

Moytura.</q>

</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Death of Balor</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Fomorians bring on their champion, Balor,
before the glance of whose terrible eye Nuada of the
Silver Hand and others of the Danaans go down.
But Lugh, seizing an opportunity when the eyelid
drooped through weariness, approached close to Balor,
and as it began to lift once more he hurled into the eye
a great stone which sank into the brain, and Balor lay
dead, as the prophecy had foretold, at the hand of his
grandson. The Fomorians were then totally routed,
and it is not recorded that they ever again gained any
authority or committed any extensive depredations in
Ireland. Lugh, the Ildánach, was then enthroned in
place of Nuada, and the myth of the victory of the solar
<pb n='118' id='page118'/>
hero over the powers of darkness and brute force is
complete.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Harp of the Dagda</hi>
</p>

<p>
A curious little incident bearing on the power which
the Danaans could exercise by the spell of music may
here be inserted. The flying Fomorians, it is told, had
made prisoner the harper of the Dagda and carried him
off with them. Lugh, the Dagda, and the warrior
Ogma followed them, and came unknown into the
banqueting-hall of the Fomorian camp. There they
saw the harp hanging on the wall. The Dagda called
to it, and immediately it flew into his hands, killing
nine men of the Fomorians on its way. The Dagda's
invocation of the harp is very singular, and not a little
puzzling:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>Come, apple-sweet murmurer,</q> he cries, <q>come,
four-angled frame of harmony, come, Summer, come,
Winter, from the mouths of harps and bags and
pipes.</q><note place='foot'><p>
O'Curry, <q>Manners and Customs,</q> iii. 214.
</p></note>
</q>
</p>

<p>
The allusion to summer and winter suggests the
practice in Indian music of allotting certain musical
modes to the different seasons of the year (and even to
different times of day), and also an Egyptian legend
referred to in Burney's <q>History of Music,</q> where the
three strings of the lyre were supposed to answer
respectively to the three seasons, spring, summer, and
winter.<note place='foot'><p>
The ancient Irish division of the year contained only these three
seasons, including autumn in summer (O'Curry, <q>Manners and
Customs,</q> iii. 217).]
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
When the Dagda got possession of the harp, the tale
goes on, he played on it the <q>three noble strains</q>
<pb n='119' id='page119'/>
which every great master of the harp should command,
namely, the Strain of Lament, which caused the hearers
to weep, the Strain of Laughter, which made them
merry, and the Strain of Slumber, or Lullaby, which
plunged them all in a profound sleep. And under
cover of that sleep the Danaan champion stole out and
escaped. It may be observed that throughout the
whole of the legendary literature of Ireland skill in
music, the art whose influence most resembles that of a
mysterious spell or gift of Faëry, is the prerogative of
the People of Dana and their descendants. Thus in
the <q>Colloquy of the Ancients,</q> a collection of tales
made about the thirteenth or fourteenth century, St.
Patrick is introduced to a minstrel, Cascorach, <q>a handsome,
curly-headed, dark-browed youth,</q> who plays so
sweet a strain that the saint and his retinue all fall
asleep. Cascorach, we are told, was son of a minstrel
of the Danaan folk. St. Patrick's scribe, Brogan, remarks,
<q>A good cast of thine art is that thou gavest us.</q>
<q>Good indeed it were,</q> said Patrick, <q>but for a twang
of the fairy spell that infests it; barring which nothing
could more nearly resemble heaven's harmony.</q><note place='foot'><p>

Some of the most beautiful of the antique Irish 
folk-melodies,&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>, the <hi rend='italic'>Coulin</hi>&mdash;are traditionally supposed

</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Names and Characteristics of the Danaan Deities</hi>
</p>

<p>
I may conclude this narrative of the Danaan conquest
with some account of the principal Danaan gods and
their attributes, which will be useful to readers of the
subsequent pages. The best with which I am acquainted
is to be found in Mr. Standish O'Grady's <q>Critical
<pb n='120' id='page120'/>
History of Ireland.</q><note place='foot'><p>
Pp. 104 <hi rend='italic'>sqq.</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>passim</hi>.
</p></note> This work is no less remarkable
for its critical insight&mdash;it was published in 1881,
when scientific study of the Celtic mythology was little
heard of&mdash;than for the true bardic imagination, kindred
to that of the ancient myth-makers themselves, which
recreates the dead forms of the past and dilates them
with the breath of life. The broad outlines in which
Mr. O'Grady has laid down the typical characteristics
of the chief personages in the Danaan cycle hardly
need any correction at this day, and have been of much
use to me in the following summary of the subject.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Dagda</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Dagda Mōr was the father and chief of the
People of Dana. A certain conception of vastness
attaches to him and to his doings. In the Second
Battle of Moytura his blows sweep down whole ranks
of the enemy, and his spear, when he trails it on the
march, draws a furrow in the ground like the fosse
which marks the mearing of a province. An element
of grotesque humour is present in some of the records
about this deity. When the Fomorians give him food
on his visit to their camp, the porridge and milk are
poured into a great pit in the ground, and he eats it
with a spoon big enough, it was said, for a man and
a woman to lie together in it. With this spoon he
scrapes the pit, when the porridge is done, and shovels
earth and gravel unconcernedly down his throat. We
have already seen that, like all the Danaans, he is a
master of music, as well as of other magical endowments,
and owns a harp which comes flying through
the air at his call. <q>The tendency to attribute life to
inanimate things is apparent in the Homeric literature,
but exercises a very great influence in the mythology
<pb n='121' id='page121'/>
of this country. The living, fiery spear of Lugh; the
magic ship of Mananan; the sword of Conary Mōr,
which sang; Cuchulain's sword, which spoke; the Lia
Fail, Stone of Destiny, which roared for joy beneath
the feet of rightful kings; the waves of the ocean,
roaring with rage and sorrow when such kings are in
jeopardy; the waters of the Avon Dia, holding back
for fear at the mighty duel between Cuchulain and
Ferdia, are but a few out of many examples.</q><note place='foot'><p>
O'Grady, <hi rend='italic'>loc. cit.</hi>
</p></note> A
legend of later times tells how once, at the death of a
great scholar, all the books in Ireland fell from their
shelves upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Angus Ōg</hi>
</p>

<p>
Angus Ōg (Angus the Young), son of the Dagda,
by Boanna (the river Boyne), was the Irish god of
love. His palace was supposed to be at New Grange,
on the Boyne. Four bright birds that ever hovered
about his head were supposed to be his kisses taking
shape in this lovely form, and at their singing love
came springing up in the hearts of youths and
maidens. Once he fell sick of love for a maiden whom
he had seen in a dream. He told the cause of his
sickness to his mother Boanna, who searched all Ireland
for the girl, but could not find her. Then the Dagda
was called in, but he too was at a loss, till he called to
his aid Bōv the Red, king of the Danaans of Munster&mdash;the 
same whom we have met with in the tale of the
Children of Lir, and who was skilled in all mysteries
and enchantments. Bōv undertook the search, and after
a year had gone by declared that he had found the
visionary maiden at a lake called the Lake of the
Dragon's Mouth.
</p>

<pb n='122' id='page122'/>

<p>
Angus goes to Bōv, and, after being entertained by
him three days, is brought to the lake shore, where he
sees thrice fifty maidens walking in couples, each couple
linked by a chain of gold, but one of them is taller than
the rest by a head and shoulders. <q>That is she!</q>
cries Angus. <q>Tell us by what name she is known.</q>
Bōv answers that her name is Caer, daughter of Ethal
Anubal, a prince of the Danaans of Connacht. Angus
laments that he is not strong enough to carry her off
from her companions, but, on Bōv's advice, betakes
himself to Ailell and Maev, the mortal King and Queen
of Connacht, for assistance. The Dagda and Angus
then both repair to the palace of Ailell, who feasts them
for a week, and then asks the cause of their coming.
When it is declared he answers, <q>We have no authority
over Ethal Anubal.</q> They send a message to him,
however, asking for the hand of Caer for Angus, but
Ethal refuses to give her up. In the end he is besieged
by the combined forces of Ailell and the Dagda, and
taken prisoner. When Caer is again demanded of him
he declares that he cannot comply, <q>for she is more
powerful than I.</q> He explains that she lives alternately
in the form of a maiden and of a swan year and
year about, <q>and on the first of November next,</q> he
says, <q>you will see her with a hundred and fifty other
swans at the Lake of the Dragon's Mouth.</q>
</p>

<p>
Angus goes there at the appointed time, and cries to
her, <q>Oh, come and speak to me!</q> <q>Who calls me?</q>
asks Caer. Angus explains who he is, and then finds
himself transformed into a swan. This is an indication
of consent, and he plunges in to join his love in the
lake. After that they fly together to the palace on the
Boyne, uttering as they go a music so divine that all
hearers are lulled to sleep for three days and nights.
</p>

<p>
Angus is the special deity and friend of beautiful
<pb n='123' id='page123'/>
youths and maidens. Dermot of the Love-spot, a
follower of Finn mac Cumhal, and lover of Grania, of
whom we shall hear later, was bred up with Angus in
the palace on the Boyne. He was the typical lover of
Irish legend. When he was slain by the wild boar of
Ben Bulben, Angus revives him and carries him off to
share his immortality in his fairy palace.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Len of Killarney</hi>
</p>

<p>
Of Bōv the Red, brother of the Dagda, we have
already heard. He had, it is said, a goldsmith named
Len, who <q>gave their ancient name to the Lakes of
Killarney, once known as Locha Lein, the Lakes of Len
of the Many Hammers. Here by the lake he wrought,
surrounded by rainbows and showers of fiery dew.</q><note place='foot'><p>

</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Lugh</hi>
</p>

<p>
Lugh has already been described.<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page112'>p. 112</ref>.
</p></note> He has more
distinctly solar attributes than any other Celtic deity;
and, as we know, his worship was spread widely over
Continental Celtica. In the tale of the Quest of the
Sons of Turenn we are told that Lugh approached the
Fomorians from the west. Then Bres, son of Balor,
arose and said: <q>I wonder that the sun is rising in the
west to-day, and in the east every other day.</q> <q>Would
it were so,</q> said his Druids. <q>Why, what else but
the sun is it?</q> said Bres. <q>It is the radiance of the
face of Lugh of the Long Arm,</q> they replied.
</p>

<p>
Lugh was the father, by the Milesian maiden
Dectera, of Cuchulain, the most heroic figure in Irish
legend, in whose story there is evidently a strong
element of the solar myth.<note place='foot'><p>
Miss Hull has discussed this subject fully in the introduction to
her invaluable work, <q>The Cuchullin Saga.</q>

</p>

<pb n='124' id='page124'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Midir the Proud</hi>
</p>

<p>
Midir the Proud is a son of the Dagda. His
fairy palace is at <hi rend='italic'>Bri Leith</hi>, or Slieve Callary, in Co.
Longford. He frequently appears in legends dealing
partly with human, partly with Danaan personages,
and is always represented as a type of splendour in his
apparel and in personal beauty. When he appears
to King Eochy on the Hill of Tara he is thus
described:<note place='foot'><p>
See the tale of <q>Etain and Midir,</q> in Chap. IV.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>It chanced that Eochaid Airemm, the King of Tara,

plain of Breg; beautiful was the colour of that plain,
and there was upon it excellent blossom glowing with
all hues that are known. And as the aforesaid Eochy
looked about and around him, he saw a young strange
warrior upon the high ground at his side. The tunic
that the warrior wore was purple in colour, his hair
was of a golden yellow, and of such length that it
reached to the edge of his shoulders. The eyes of the
young warrior were lustrous and grey; in the one
hand he held a fine pointed spear, in the other a shield
with a white central boss, and with gems of gold upon
it. And Eochaid held his peace, for he knew that none
such had been in Tara on the night before, and the
gate that led into the <hi rend='italic'>Liss</hi> had not at that time been
thrown open.</q><note place='foot'><p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Lir and Mananan</hi>
</p>

<p>
Lir, as Mr. O'Grady remarks, <q>appears in two
distinct forms. In the first he is a vast, impersonal
presence commensurate with the sea; in fact, the
Greek Oceanus. In the second, he is a separate person
dwelling invisibly on Slieve Fuad,</q> in Co. Armagh.
We hear little of him in Irish legend, where the attributes
of the sea-god are mostly conferred on his son,
Mananan.
</p>

<p>
This deity is one of the most popular in Irish
mythology. He was lord of the sea, beyond or under
which the Land of Youth or Islands of the Dead were
supposed to lie; he therefore was the guide of man to
this country. He was master of tricks and illusions,
and owned all kinds of magical possessions&mdash;the boat
named Ocean-sweeper, which obeyed the thought of
those who sailed in it and went without oar or sail, the
steed Aonbarr, which could travel alike on sea or land,
and the sword named The Answerer, which no armour
could resist. White-crested waves were called the
Horses of Mananan, and it was forbidden (<hi rend='italic'>tabu</hi>) for
the solar hero, Cuchulain, to perceive them&mdash;this indicated
the daily death of the sun at his setting in the
western waves. Mananan wore a great cloak which
was capable of taking on every kind of colour, like
the widespread field of the sea as looked on from
a height; and as the protector of the island of Erin
it was said that when any hostile force invaded it
they heard his thunderous tramp and the flapping
of his mighty cloak as he marched angrily round and
round their camp at night. The Isle of Man, seen
dimly from the Irish coast, was supposed to be the
throne of Mananan, and to take its name from this
deity.
</p>


<pb n='126' id='page126'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Goddess Dana</hi>
</p>

<p>
The greatest of the Danaan goddesses was Dana,
<q>mother of the Irish gods,</q> as she is called in an early
text. She was daughter of the Dagda, and, like him, associated
with ideas of fertility and blessing. According
to d'Arbois de Jubainville, she was identical with the
goddess Brigit, who was so widely worshipped in
Celtica. Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharba are said to have
been her sons&mdash;these really represent but one person,
in the usual Irish fashion of conceiving the divine
power in triads. The name of Brian, who takes the
lead in all the exploits of the brethren,<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page114'>p. 114</ref>.
</p></note> is a derivation
from a more ancient form, Brenos, and under this
form was the god to whom the Celts attributed their
victories at the Allia and at Delphi, mistaken by
Roman and Greek chroniclers for an earthly leader.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Morrigan</hi>
</p>

<p>
There was also an extraordinary goddess named the
Morrigan,<note place='foot'><p>
I cannot agree with Mr. O'Grady's identification of this goddess
with Dana, though the name appears to mean <q>The Great Queen.</q>
</p></note> who appears to embody all that is perverse
and horrible among supernatural powers. She delighted
in setting men at war, and fought among them herself,
changing into many frightful shapes and often hovering
above fighting armies in the aspect of a crow. She met
Cuchulain once and proffered him her love in the guise
of a human maid. He refused it, and she persecuted
him thenceforward for the most of his life. Warring
with him once in the middle of the stream, she turned
herself into a water-serpent, and then into a mass of
water-weeds, seeking to entangle and drown him. But
he conquered and wounded her, and she afterwards
<pb n='127' id='page127'/>
became his friend. Before his last battle she passed
through Emain Macha at night, and broke the pole of
his chariot as a warning.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Cleena's Wave</hi>
</p>

<p>
One of the most notable landmarks of Ireland was the
<hi rend='italic'>Tonn Cliodhna</hi>, or <q>Wave of Cleena,</q> on the seashore
at Glandore Bay, in Co. Cork. The story about Cleena
exists in several versions, which do not agree with each
other except in so far as she seems to have been a
Danaan maiden once living in Mananan's country, the
Land of Youth beyond the sea. Escaping thence with
a mortal lover, as one of the versions tells, she landed
on the southern coast of Ireland, and her lover, Keevan
of the Curling Locks, went off to hunt in the woods.
Cleena, who remained on the beach, was lulled to sleep
by fairy music played by a minstrel of Mananan, when
a great wave of the sea swept up and carried her back
to Fairyland, leaving her lover desolate. Hence the
place was called the Strand of Cleena's Wave.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Goddess Ainé</hi>
</p>

<p>
Another topical goddess was Ainé, the patroness
of Munster, who is still venerated by the people
of that county. She was the daughter of the Danaan
Owel, a foster-son of Mananan and a Druid. She
is in some sort a love-goddess, continually inspiring
mortals with passion. She was ravished, it was said,
by Ailill Olum, King of Munster, who was slain in
consequence by her magic arts, and the story is repeated
in far later times about another mortal lover,
who was not, however, slain, a Fitzgerald, to whom she
bore the famous wizard Earl.<note place='foot'><p>
Gerald, the fourth Earl of Desmond. He disappeared, it is said,
in 1398, and the legend goes that he still lives beneath the waters of
Loch Gur, and may be seen riding round its banks on his white steed
once every seven years. He was surnamed <q>Gerald the Poet</q> from
the <q>witty and ingenious</q> verses he composed in Gaelic. Wizardry,
poetry, and science were all united in one conception in the mind of
the ancient Irish.
</p></note> Many of the aristocratic
<pb n='128' id='page128'/>
families of Munster claimed descent from this union.
Her name still clings to the <q>Hill of Ainé</q> (Knockainey),
near Loch Gur, in Munster. All the Danaan
deities in the popular imagination were earth-gods, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>dei
terreni</foreign>, associated with ideas of fertility and increase.
Ainé is not heard much of in the bardic literature,
but she is very prominent in the folk-lore of the
neighbourhood. At the bidding of her son, Earl
Gerald, she planted all Knockainey with pease in a
single night. She was, and perhaps still is, worshipped
on Midsummer Eve by the peasantry, who carried
torches of hay and straw, tied on poles and lighted, round
her hill at night. Afterwards they dispersed themselves
among their cultivated fields and pastures, waving the
torches over the crops and the cattle to bring luck and
increase for the following year. On one night, as told
by Mr. D. Fitzgerald,<note place='foot'><p>
<q>Popular Tales of Ireland,</q> by D. Fitzgerald, in <q>Revue
Celtique,</q> vol. iv.
</p></note> who has collected the local traditions
about her, the ceremony was omitted owing to the
death of one of the neighbours. Yet the peasantry at
night saw the torches in greater number than ever
circling the hill, and Ainé herself in front, directing and
ordering the procession.
</p>

<p>
<q>On another St. John's Night a number of girls had
stayed late on the Hill watching the <hi rend='italic'>cliars</hi> (torches) and
joining in the games. Suddenly Ainé appeared among
them, thanked them for the honour they had done her,
but said she now wished them to go home, as <hi rend='italic'>they wanted
the hill to themselves</hi>. She let them understand whom she
<pb n='129' id='page129'/>
meant by <hi rend='italic'>they</hi>, for calling some of the girls she made
them look through a ring, when behold, the hill
appeared crowded with people before invisible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here,</q> observed Mr. Alfred Nutt, <q>we have the
antique ritual carried out on a spot hallowed to one of
the antique powers, watched over and shared in by
those powers themselves. Nowhere save in Gaeldom
could be found such a pregnant illustration of the
identity of the fairy class with the venerable powers
to ensure whose goodwill rites and sacrifices, originally
fierce and bloody, now a mere simulacrum of their
pristine form, have been performed for countless ages.</q><note place='foot'><p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Sinend and the Well of Knowledge</hi>
</p>

<p>
There is a singular myth which, while intended to
account for the name of the river Shannon, expresses
the Celtic veneration for poetry and science, combined
with the warning that they may not be approached
without danger. The goddess Sinend, it was said,
daughter of Lodan son of Lir, went to a certain well
named Connla's Well, which is under the sea&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, in
the Land of Youth in Fairyland. <q>That is a well,</q>
says the bardic narrative, <q>at which are the hazels
of wisdom and inspirations, that is, the hazels of
the science of poetry, and in the same hour their fruit
and their blossom and their foliage break forth, and
then fall upon the well in the same shower, which raises
upon the water a royal surge of purple.</q> When
Sinend came to the well we are not told what rites or
preparation she had omitted, but the angry waters broke
forth and overwhelmed her, and washed her up on the
Shannon shore, where she died, giving to the river its
name.<note place='foot'><p>
In Irish, <hi rend='italic'>Sionnain</hi>.
</p></note> This myth of the hazels of inspiration and
<pb n='130' id='page130'/>
knowledge and their association with springing water
runs through all Irish legend, and has been finely
treated by a living Irish poet, Mr. G.W. Russell, in
the following verses:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>>A cabin on the mountain-side hid in a grassy nook,</q></l>
<l>With door and window open wide, where friendly stars may look;</l>
<l>The rabbit shy may patter in, the winds may enter free</l>
<l>Who roam around the mountain throne in living ecstasy.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>And when the sun sets dimmed in eve, and purple fills the air,</q></l>
<l>I think the sacred hazel-tree is dropping berries there,</l>
<l>From starry fruitage, waved aloft where Connla's Well o'erflows;</l>
<l>For sure, the immortal waters run through every wind that blows.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>I think when Night towers up aloft and shakes the trembling dew,</q></l>
<l>How every high and lonely thought that thrills my spirit through</l>
<l>Is but a shining berry dropped down through the purple air,</l>
<l><q rend='pre: none'>And from the magic tree of life the fruit falls everywhere.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Coming of the Milesians</hi>
</p>

<p>
After the Second Battle of Moytura the Danaans held
rule in Ireland until the coming of the Milesians, the
sons of Miled. These are conceived in Irish legend as
an entirely human race, yet in their origin they, like
the other invaders of Ireland, go back to a divine and
mythical ancestry. Miled, whose name occurs as a god
in a Celtic inscription from Hungary, is represented as
a son of Bilé. Bilé, like Balor, is one of the names of
the god of Death, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, of the Underworld. They come
from <q>Spain</q>&mdash;the usual term employed by the later
rationalising historians for the Land of the Dead.
</p>

<p>
The manner of their coming into Ireland was as
follows: Ith, the grandfather of Miled, dwelt in a great
tower which his father, Bregon, had built in <q>Spain.</q>
One clear winter's day, when looking out westwards
from this lofty tower, he saw the coast of Ireland in
the distance, and resolved to sail to the unknown land.
</p>


<pb n='131' id='page131'/>

<p>
He embarked with ninety warriors, and took land at
Corcadyna, in the south-west. In connexion with this
episode I may quote a passage of great beauty and
interest from de Jubainville's <q>Irish Mythological
Cycle</q>:<note place='foot'><p>
Translation by R.I. Best.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>According to an unknown writer cited by Plutarch,
who died about the year 120 of the present era, and
also by Procopius, who wrote in the sixth century A.D.,
<q>the Land of the Dead</q> is the western extremity of
Great Britain, separated from the eastern by an impassable
wall. On the northern coast of Gaul, says the
legend, is a populace of mariners whose business is to
carry the dead across from the continent to their last
abode in the island of Britain. The mariners, awakened
in the night by the whisperings of some mysterious
voice, arise and go down to the shore, where they find
ships awaiting them which are not their own,<note place='foot'><p>
The solar vessels found in dolmen carvings. See Chap. II.
p. 71 <hi rend='italic'>sqq</hi>. Note that the Celtic spirits, though invisible, are material
and have weight; not so those in Vergil and Dante.
</p></note> and, in
these, invisible beings, under whose weight the vessels
sink almost to the gunwales. They go on board, and
with a single stroke of the oar, says one text, in one
hour, says another, they arrive at their destination,
though with their own vessels, aided by sails, it would
have taken them at least a day and a night to reach the
coast of Britain. When they come to the other shore
the invisible passengers land, and at the same time the
unloaded ships are seen to rise above the waves, and a
voice is heard announcing the names of the new arrivals,
who have just been added to the inhabitants of the
Land of the Dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>One stroke of the oar, one hour's voyage at most,
suffices for the midnight journey which transfers the
<pb n='132' id='page132'/>
Dead from the Gaulish continent to their final abode.
Some mysterious law, indeed, brings together in the
night the great spaces which divide the domain of the
living from that of the dead in daytime. It was the
same law which enabled Ith one fine winter evening to
perceive from the Tower of Bregon, in the Land of the
Dead, the shores of Ireland, or the land of the living.
The phenomenon took place in winter; for winter is a
sort of night; winter, like night, lowers the barriers
between the regions of Death and those of Life; like
night, winter gives to life the semblance of death, and
suppresses, as it were, the dread abyss that lies between
the two.</q>
</p>

<p>
At this time, it is said, Ireland was ruled by three
Danaan kings, grandsons of the Dagda. Their names
were MacCuill, MacCecht, and MacGrené, and their
wives were named respectively Banba, Fohla, and Eriu.
The Celtic habit of conceiving divine persons in triads
is here illustrated. These triads represent one person
each, and the mythical character of that personage is
evident from the name of one of them, MacGrené, Son
of the Sun. The names of the three goddesses have
each at different times been applied to Ireland, but that
of the third, Eriu, has alone persisted, and in the dative
form, Erinn, is a poetic name for the country to this
day. That Eriu is the wife of MacGrené means, as de
Jubainville observes, that the Sun-god, the god of Day,
Life, and Science, has wedded the land and is reigning
over it.
</p>

<p>
Ith, on landing, finds that the Danaan king, Neit,
has just been slain in a battle with the Fomorians, and
the three sons, MacCuill and the others, are at the
fortress of Aileach, in Co. Donegal, arranging for a
division of the land among themselves. At first they
<pb n='133' id='page133'/>
welcome Ith, and ask him to settle their inheritance.
Ith gives his judgment, but, in concluding, his admiration
for the newly discovered country breaks out:
<q>Act,</q> he says, <q>according to the laws of justice, for
the country you dwell in is a good one, it is rich in
fruit and honey, in wheat and in fish; and in heat and
cold it is temperate.</q> From this panegyric the Danaans
conclude that 1th has designs upon their land, and they
seize him and put him to death. His companions,
however, recover his body and bear it back with them
in their ships to <q>Spain</q>; when the children of Miled
resolve to take vengeance for the outrage and prepare
to invade Ireland.
</p>

<p>
They were commanded by thirty-six chiefs, each
having his own ship with his family and his followers.
Two of the company are said to have perished on the
way. One of the sons of Miled, having climbed to the
masthead of his vessel to look out for the coast of
Ireland, fell into the sea and was drowned. The other
was Skena, wife of the poet Amergin, son of Miled,
who died on the way. The Milesians buried her when
they landed, and called the place <q>Inverskena</q> after
her; this was the ancient name of the Kenmare River
in Co. Kerry.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was on a Thursday, the first of May, and the
seventeenth day of the moon, that the sons of Miled
arrived in Ireland. Partholan also landed in Ireland
on the first of May, but on a different day of the week
and of the moon; and it was on the first day of May,
too, that the pestilence came which in the space of one
week destroyed utterly his race. The first of May was
sacred to Beltené, one of the names of the god of
Death, the god who gives life to men and takes it
away from them again. Thus it was on the feast day
<pb n='134' id='page134'/>
of this god that the sons of Miled began their conquest
of Ireland.</q><note place='foot'><p>
De Jubainville, <q>Irish Mythological Cycle,</q> p. 136. Beltené is
the modern Irish name for the month of May, and is derived from an
ancient root preserved in the Old Irish compound <hi rend='italic'>epelta</hi>, <q>dead.</q>

</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Poet Amergin</hi>
</p>

<p>
When the poet Amergin set foot upon the soil of
Ireland it is said that he chanted a strange and mystical
lay:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>I am the Wind that blows over the sea,</q></l>
<l>I am the Wave of the Ocean;</l>
<l>I am the Murmur of the billows;</l>
<l>I am the Ox of the Seven Combats;</l>
<l>I am the Vulture upon the rock;</l>
<l>I am a Ray of the Sun;</l>
<l>I am the fairest of Plants;</l>
<l>I am a Wild Boar in valour;</l>
<l>I am a Salmon in the Water;</l>
<l>I am a Lake in the plain;</l>
<l>I am the Craft of the artificer;</l>
<l>I am a Word of Science;</l>
<l>I am the Spear-point that gives battle;</l>
<l>I am the god that creates in the head of man the fire of thought.</l>
<l>Who is it that enlightens the assembly upon the mountain,if not I?</l>
<l>Who telleth the ages of the moon, if not I?</l>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Who showeth the place where the sun goes to rest, if not I?</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
De Jubainville, whose translation I have in the main
followed, observes upon this strange utterance:
</p>

<p>
<q>There is a lack of order in this composition, the
ideas, fundamental and subordinate, are jumbled together
without method; but there is no doubt as to the meaning: 
the <hi rend='italic'>filé</hi> [poet] is the Word of Science, he is the
god who gives to man the fire of thought; and as
science is not distinct from its object, as God and Nature
are but one, the being of the <hi rend='italic'>filé</hi> is mingled with the
<pb n='135' id='page135'/>
winds and the waves, with the wild animals and the
warrior's arms.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Irish Mythological Cycle,</q> p. 138.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Two other poems are attributed to Amergin, in which
he invokes the land and physical features of Ireland to
aid him:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>I invoke the land of Ireland,</q></l>
<l>Shining, shining sea;</l>
<l>Fertile, fertile Mountain;</l>
<l>Gladed, gladed wood!</l>

<l><q rend='pre: none'>Fish-abounding lake!</q><note place='foot'><p>

<q>Transactions,</q> vol. v.

</lg>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Judgment of Amergin</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Milesian host, after landing, advance to Tara,
where they find the three kings of the Danaans
awaiting them, and summon them to deliver up the
island. The Danaans ask for three days' time to consider
whether they shall quit Ireland, or submit, or give
battle; and they propose to leave the decision, upon
their request, to Amergin. Amergin pronounces judgment&mdash;<q>the
first judgment which was delivered in
Ireland.</q> He agrees that the Milesians must not take
their foes by surprise&mdash;they are to withdraw the length
of nine waves from the shore, and then return; if
they then conquer the Danaans the land is to be fairly
theirs by right of battle.
</p>

<p>
The Milesians submit to this decision and embark
on their ships. But no sooner have they drawn <hi rend='italic'>off</hi> for
this mystical distance of the nine waves than a mist and
storm are raised by the sorceries of the Danaans&mdash;the
coast of Ireland is hidden from their sight, and they
wander dispersed upon the ocean. To ascertain if it is
<pb n='136' id='page136'/>
a natural or a Druidic tempest which afflicts them, a man
named Aranan is sent up to the masthead to see if the
wind is blowing there also or not. He is flung from
the swaying mast, but as he falls to his death he cries
his message to his shipmates: <q>There is no storm
aloft.</q> Amergin, who as poet&mdash;that is to say, Druid&mdash;takes
the lead in all critical situations, thereupon chants
his incantation to the land of Erin. The wind falls,
and they turn their prows, rejoicing, towards the shore.
But one of the Milesian lords, Eber Donn, exults in
brutal rage at the prospect of putting all the dwellers in
Ireland to the sword; the tempest immediately springs
up again, and many of the Milesian ships founder,
Eber Donn's being among them. At last a remnant of
the Milesians find their way to shore, and land in the
estuary of the Boyne.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Defeat of the Danaans</hi>
</p>

<p>
A great battle with the Danaans at Telltown<note place='foot'><p>
Teltin; so named after the goddess Telta. See <ref target='page103'>p. 103</ref>.
</p></note> then
follows. The three kings and three queens of the
Danaans, with many of their people, are slain, and the
children of Miled&mdash;the last of the mythical invaders of
Ireland&mdash;enter upon the sovranty of Ireland. But the
People of Dana do not withdraw. By their magic art
they cast over themselves a veil of invisibility, which
they can put on or off as they choose. There are two
Irelands henceforward, the spiritual and the earthly.
The Danaans dwell in the spiritual Ireland, which is
portioned out among them by their great overlord, the
Dagda. Where the human eye can see but green
mounds and ramparts, the relics of ruined fortresses or
sepulchres, there rise the fairy palaces of the defeated
divinities; there they hold their revels in eternal sunshine,
nourished by the magic meat and ale that give
<pb n='137' id='page137'/>
them undying youth and beauty; and thence they
come forth at times to mingle with mortal men in love
or in war. The ancient mythical literature conceives
them as heroic and splendid in strength and beauty. In
later times, and as Christian influences grew stronger,
they dwindle into fairies, the People of the Sidhe;<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Shee.</q> It means literally the People of the
[Fairy] Mounds.
</p></note>
but they have never wholly perished; to this day the
Land of Youth and its inhabitants live in the imagination
of the Irish peasant.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Meaning of the Danaan Myth</hi>
</p>

<p>
All myths constructed by a primitive people are
symbols, and if we can discover what it is that they
symbolise we have a valuable clue to the spiritual
character, and sometimes even to the history, of the
people from whom they sprang. Now the meaning of
the Danaan myth as it appears in the bardic literature,
though it has undergone much distortion before it
reached us, is perfectly clear. The Danaans represent
the Celtic reverence for science, poetry, and artistic skill,
blended, of course, with the earlier conception of the
divinity of the powers of Light. In their combat with
the Firbolgs the victory of the intellect over dulness
and ignorance is plainly portrayed&mdash;the comparison of
the heavy, blunt weapon of the Firbolgs with the light
and penetrating spears of the People of Dana is an
indication which it is impossible to mistake. Again, in
their struggle with a far more powerful and dangerous
enemy, the Fomorians, we are evidently to see the
combat of the powers of Light with evil of a more
positive kind than that represented by the Firbolgs.
The Fomorians stand not for mere dulness or
<pb n='138' id='page138'/>
stupidity, but for the forces of tyranny, cruelty, and
greed&mdash;for moral rather than for intellectual darkness.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Meaning of the Milesian Myth</hi>
</p>

<p>
But the myth of the struggle of the Danaans with
the sons of Miled is more difficult to interpret. How
does it come that the lords of light and beauty, wielding
all the powers of thought (represented by magic and
sorcery), succumbed to a human race, and were dispossessed
by them of their hard-won inheritance?
What is the meaning of this shrinking of their powers
which at once took place when the Milesians came on
the scene? The Milesians were not on the side of the
powers of darkness. They were guided by Amergin,
a clear embodiment of the idea of poetry and thought.
They were regarded with the utmost veneration, and
the dominant families of Ireland all traced their descent
to them. Was the Kingdom of Light, then, divided
against itself? Or, if not, to what conception in the
Irish mind are we to trace the myth of the Milesian
invasion and victory?
</p>

<p>
The only answer I can see to this puzzling question
is to suppose that the Milesian myth originated at a
much later time than the others, and was, in its main
features, the product of Christian influences. The
People of Dana were in possession of the country, but
they were pagan divinities&mdash;they could not stand for
the progenitors of a Christian Ireland. They had
somehow or other to be got rid of, and a race of less
embarrassing antecedents substituted for them. So the
Milesians were fetched from <q>Spain</q> and endowed
with the main characteristics, only more humanised, of
the People of Dana. But the latter, in contradistinction
to the usual attitude of early Christianity, are
treated very tenderly in the story of their overthrow.
<pb n='139' id='page139'/>
One of them has the honour of giving her name to the
island, the brutality of one of the conquerors towards
them is punished with death, and while dispossessed
of the lordship of the soil they still enjoy life in the
fair world which by their magic art they have made
invisible to mortals. They are no longer gods, but
they are more than human, and frequent instances
occur in which they are shown as coming forth from
their fairy world, being embraced in the Christian fold,
and entering into heavenly bliss. With two cases of
this redemption of the Danaans we shall close this
chapter on the Invasion Myths of Ireland.
</p>

<p>
The first is the strange and beautiful tale of the
Transformation of the Children of Lir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Children of Lir</hi>
</p>

<p>
Lir was a Danaan divinity, the father of the sea-god
Mananan who continually occurs in magical tales of
the Milesian cycle. He had married in succession two
sisters, the second of whom was named Aoife.<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Eefa.</q>
</p></note> She
was childless, but the former wife of Lir had left him
four children, a girl named Fionuala<note place='foot'><p>
This name means <q>The Maid of the Fair Shoulder.</q>
</p></note> and three boys.
The intense love of Lir for the children made the stepmother
jealous, and she ultimately resolved on their
destruction. It will be observed, by the way, that the
People of Dana, though conceived as unaffected by
time, and naturally immortal, are nevertheless subject
to violent death either at the hands of each other or
even of mortals.
</p>

<p>
With her guilty object in view, Aoife goes on a
journey to a neighbouring Danaan king, Bōv the Red,
taking the four children with her. Arriving at a
lonely place by Lake Derryvaragh, in Westmeath, she
<pb n='140' id='page140'/>
orders her attendants to slay the children. They
refuse, and rebuke her. Then she resolves to do it
herself; but, says the legend, <q>her womanhood overcame
her,</q> and instead of killing the Children she
transforms them by spells of sorcery into four white
swans, and lays on them the following doom: three
hundred years they are to spend on the waters of Lake
Derryvaragh, three hundred on the Straits of Moyle
(between Ireland and Scotland), and three hundred on
the Atlantic by Erris and Inishglory. After that, <q>when
the woman of the South is mated with the man of
the North,</q> the enchantment is to have an end.
</p>

<p>
When the children fail to arrive with Aoife at the
palace of Bōv her guilt is discovered, and Bōv changes
her into <q>a demon of the air.</q> She flies forth shrieking,
and is heard of no more in the tale. But Lir and
Bōv seek out the swan-children, and find that they have
not only human speech, but have preserved the characteristic
Danaan gift of making wonderful music. From
all parts of the island companies of the Danaan folk
resort to Lake Derryvaragh to hear this wondrous
music and to converse with the swans, and during that
time a great peace and gentleness seemed to pervade
the land.
</p>

<p>
But at last the day came for them to leave the
fellowship of their kind and take up their life by the
wild cliffs and ever angry sea of the northern coast.
Here they knew the worst of loneliness, cold, and
storm. Forbidden to land, their feathers froze to the
rocks in the winter nights, and they were often buffeted
and driven apart by storms. As Fionuala sings:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Cruel to us was Aoife</q></l>
<l>Who played her magic upon us,</l>
<l>And drove us out on the water&mdash;</l>
<l>Four wonderful snow-white swans.</l>
</lg>


<pb n='141' id='page141'/>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Our bath is the frothing brine,</q></l>
<l>In bays by red rocks guarded;</l>
<l>For mead at our father's table</l>
<l>We drink of the salt, blue sea.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Three sons and a single daughter,</q></l>
<l>In clefts of the cold rocks dwelling,</l>
<l>The hard rocks, cruel to mortals&mdash;</l>
<l><q rend='pre: none'>We are full of keening to-night.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Fionuala, the eldest of the four, takes the lead in all
their doings, and mothers the younger children most
tenderly, wrapping her plumage round them on nights
of frost. At last the time comes to enter on the third
and last period of their doom, and they take flight for
the western shores of Mayo. Here too they suffer
much hardship; but the Milesians have now come into
the land, and a young farmer named Evric, dwelling on
the shores of Erris Bay, finds out who and what the
swans are, and befriends them. To him they tell their
story, and through him it is supposed to have been
preserved and handed down. When the final period
of their suffering is close at hand they resolve to fly
towards the palace of their father Lir, who dwells, we
are told, at the Hill of the White Field, in Armagh, to
see how things have fared with him. They do so;
but not knowing what has happened on the coming of
the Milesians, they are shocked and bewildered to find
nothing but green mounds and whin-bushes and nettles
where once stood&mdash;and still stands, only that they cannot
see it&mdash;the palace of their father. Their eyes are holden,
we are to understand, because a higher destiny was in
store for them than to return to the Land of Youth.
</p>

<p>
On Erris Bay they hear for the first time the sound
of a Christian bell. It comes from the chapel of a
hermit who has established himself there. The swans
are at first startled and terrified by the <q>thin, dreadful
<pb n='142' id='page142'/>
sound,</q> but afterwards approach and make themselves
known to the hermit, who instructs them in the faith,
and they join him in singing the offices of the Church.
</p>

<p>
Now it happens that a princess of Munster, Deoca,
(the <q>woman of the South</q>) became betrothed to a
Connacht chief named Lairgnen, and begged him as a
wedding gift to procure for her the four wonderful
singing swans whose fame had come to her. He asks
them of the hermit, who refuses to give them up, whereupon
the <q>man of the North</q> seizes them violently by
the silver chains with which the hermit had coupled them,
and drags them off to Deoca. This is their last trial.
Arrived in her presence, an awful transformation befalls
them. The swan plumage falls off, and reveals, not,
indeed, the radiant forms of the Danaan divinities,
but four withered, snowy-haired, and miserable human
beings, shrunken in the decrepitude of their vast old
age. Lairgnen flies from the place in horror, but the
hermit prepares to administer baptism at once, as death
is rapidly approaching them. <q>Lay us in one grave,</q>
says Fionuala, <q>and place Conn at my right hand and
Fiachra at my left, and Hugh before my face, for there
they were wont to be when I sheltered them many
a winter night upon the seas of Moyle.</q> And so it
was done, and they went to heaven; but the hermit, it
is said, sorrowed for them to the end of his earthly
days.<note place='foot'><p>
The story here summarised is given in full in the writer's
<q>High Deeds of Finn</q> (Harrap and Co.).
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
In all Celtic legend there is no more tender and
beautiful tale than this of the Children of Lir.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tale of Ethné</hi>
</p>

<p>
But the imagination of the Celtic bard always played
with delight on the subjects of these transition tales,
<pb n='143' id='page143'/>
where the reconciling of the pagan order with the
Christian was the theme. The same conception is
embodied in the tale of Ethné, which we have now to
tell.
</p>

<p>
It is said that Mananan mac Lir had a daughter who
was given in fosterage to the Danaan prince Angus,
whose fairy palace was at Brugh na Boyna. This is the
great sepulchral tumulus now called New Grange, on the
Boyne. At the same time the steward of Angus had
a daughter born to him whose name was Ethné, and
who was allotted to the young princess as her handmaiden.
</p>

<p>
Ethné grew up into a lovely and gentle maiden, but
it was discovered one day that she took no nourishment
of any kind, although the rest of the household fed as
usual on the magic swine of Mananan, which might be
eaten to-day and were alive again for the feast to-morrow.
Mananan was called in to penetrate the
mystery, and the following curious story came to light.
One of the chieftains of the Danaans who had been on
a visit with Angus, smitten by the girl's beauty, had
endeavoured to possess her by force. This woke in
Ethné's pure spirit the moral nature which is proper to
man, and which the Danaan divinities know not. As
the tale says, her <q>guardian demon</q> left her, and an
angel of the true God took its place. After that event
she abstained altogether from the food of Faëry, and
was miraculously nourished by the will of God. After
a time, however, Mananan and Angus, who had been on
a voyage to the East, brought back thence two cows
whose milk never ran dry, and as they were supposed
to have come from a sacred land Ethné lived on their
milk thenceforward.
</p>

<p>
All this is supposed to have happened during the
reign of Eremon, the first Milesian king of all Ireland,
<pb n='144' id='page144'/>
who was contemporary with King David. At the time
of the coming of St. Patrick, therefore, Ethné would
have been about fifteen hundred years of age. The
Danaan folk grow up from childhood to maturity, but
then they abide unaffected by the lapse of time.
</p>

<p>
Now it happened one summer day that the Danaan
princess whose handmaid Ethné was went down with
all her maidens to bathe in the river Boyne. When
arraying themselves afterwards Ethné discovered, to her
dismay&mdash;and this incident was, of course, an instance
of divine interest in her destiny&mdash;that she had lost the
Veil of Invisibility, conceived here as a magic charm
worn on the person, which gave her the entrance to the
Danaan fairyland and hid her from mortal eyes. She
could not find her way back to the palace of Angus, and
wandered up and down the banks of the river seeking
in vain for her companions and her home. At last
she came to a walled garden, and, looking through the
gate, saw inside a stone house of strange appearance
and a man in a long brown robe. The man was a
Christian monk, and the house was a little church or
oratory. He beckoned her in, and when she had told
her story to him he brought her to St. Patrick, who
completed her adoption into the human family by
giving her the rite of baptism.
</p>

<p>
Now comes in a strangely pathetic episode which
reveals the tenderness, almost the regret, with which
early Irish Christianity looked back on the lost world
of paganism. As Ethné was one day praying in the
little church by the Boyne she heard suddenly a
rushing sound in the air, and innumerable voices, as
it seemed from a great distance, lamenting and calling
her name. It was her Danaan kindred, who were still
seeking for her in vain. She sprang up to reply, but
was so overcome with emotion that she fell in a swoon
<pb n='145' id='page145'/>
on the floor. She recovered her senses after a while,
but from that day she was struck with a mortal sickness,
and in no long time she died, with her head upon the
breast of St. Patrick, who administered to her the last
rites, and ordained that the church should be named
after her, Kill Ethné&mdash;a name doubtless borne, at the
time the story was composed, by some real church on
the banks of Boyne.<note place='foot'><p>
It may be mentioned that the syllable <q>Kill,</q> which enters into
so many Irish place-names (Kilkenny, Killiney, Kilcooley, &amp;c.),
usually represents the Latin <hi rend='italic'>cella</hi>, a monastic cell, shrine, or church.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Christianity and Paganism in Ireland</hi>
</p>

<p>
These, taken together with numerous other legendary
incidents which might be quoted, illustrate well the attitude
of the early Celtic Christians, in Ireland at least,
towards the divinities of the older faith. They seem to
preclude the idea that at the time of the conversion of
Ireland the pagan religion was associated with cruel
and barbarous practices, on which the national memory
would look back with horror and detestation.

CHAPTER IV: THE EARLY MILESIAN KINGS
</head>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Danaans after the Milesian Conquest</hi>
</p>

<p>
The kings and heroes of the Milesian race now
fill the foreground of the stage in Irish legendary
history. But, as we have indicated, the Danaan
divinities are by no means forgotten. The fairyland in
which they dwell is ordinarily inaccessible to mortals,
yet it is ever near at hand; the invisible barriers may
be, and often are, crossed by mortal men, and the Danaans
themselves frequently come forth from them; mortals
may win brides of Faëry who mysteriously leave them
after a while, and women bear glorious children of
supernatural fatherhood. Yet whatever the Danaans
may have been in the original pre-Christian conceptions
of the Celtic Irish, it would be a mistake to suppose
that they figure in the legends, as these have now come
down to us, in the light of gods as we understand this
term. They are for the most part radiantly beautiful,
they are immortal (with limitations), and they wield
mysterious powers of sorcery and enchantment. But
no sort of moral governance of the world is ever for
a moment ascribed to them, nor (in the bardic literature)
is any act of worship paid to them. They do not die
naturally, but they can be slain both by each other and by
mortals, and on the whole the mortal race is the stronger.
Their strength when they come into conflict (as frequently
happens) with men lies in stratagem and illusion;
when the issue can be fairly knit between the rival
powers it is the human that conquers. The early
kings and heroes of the Milesian race are, indeed, often
represented as so mightily endowed with supernatural
power that it is impossible to draw a clear distinction
between them and the People of Dana in this respect.
<pb n='147' id='page147'/>
The Danaans are much nobler and more exalted beings,
as they figure in the bardic literature, than the fairies
into which they ultimately degenerated in the popular
imagination; they may be said to hold a position
intermediate between these and the Greek deities as
portrayed in Homer. But the true worship of the
Celts, in Ireland as elsewhere, seems to have been paid,
not to these poetical personifications of their ideals of
power and beauty, but rather to elemental forces represented
by actual natural phenomena&mdash;rocks, rivers, the
sun, the wind, the sea. The most binding of oaths
was to swear by the Wind and Sun, or to invoke some
other power of nature; no name of any Danaan divinity
occurs in an Irish oath formula. When, however, in
the later stages of the bardic literature, and still more
in the popular conceptions, the Danaan deities had
begun to sink into fairies, we find rising into prominence
a character probably older than that ascribed to them
in the literature, and, in a way, more august. In the
literature it is evident that they were originally representatives
of science and poetry&mdash;the intellectual powers
of man. But in the popular mind they represented,
probably at all times and certainly in later Christian
times, not intellectual powers, but those associated with
the fecundity of earth. They were, as a passage in the
Book of Armagh names them, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>dei terreni</foreign>, earth-gods,
and were, and are still, invoked by the peasantry to
yield increase and fertility. The literary conception of
them is plainly Druidic in origin, the other popular;
and the popular and doubtless older conception has
proved the more enduring.
</p>

<p>
But these features of Irish mythology will appear
better in the actual tales than in any critical discussion
of them; and to the tales let us now return.
</p>


<pb n='148' id='page148'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Milesian Settlement of Ireland</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Milesians had three leaders when they set out
for the conquest of Ireland&mdash;Eber Donn (Brown Eber),
Eber Finn (Fair Eber), and Eremon. Of these the
first-named, as we have seen, was not allowed to enter
the land&mdash;he perished as a punishment for his brutality.
When the victory over the Danaans was secure the
two remaining brothers turned to the Druid Amergin
for a judgment as to their respective titles to the
sovranty. Eremon was the elder of the two, but Eber
refused to submit to him. Thus Irish history begins,
alas! with dissension and jealousy. Amergin decided
that the land should belong to Eremon for his life, and
pass to Eber after his death. But Eber refused to
submit to the award, and demanded an immediate
partition of the new-won territory. This was agreed
to, and Eber took the southern half of Ireland, <q>from
the Boyne to the Wave of Cleena,</q><note place='foot'><p>
Cleena (<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Cliodhna</foreign>) was a Danaan princess about whom a legend
is told connected with the Bay of Glandore in Co. Cork. See
p. 127.
</p></note> while Eremon
occupied the north. But even so the brethren could
not be at peace, and after a short while war broke out
between them. Eber was slain, and Eremon became
sole King of Ireland, which he ruled from Tara, the
traditional seat of that central authority which was
always a dream of the Irish mind, but never a reality of
Irish history.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Tiernmas and Crom Cruach</hi>
</p>

<p>
Of the kings who succeeded Eremon, and the battles
they fought and the forests they cleared away and the
rivers and lakes that broke out in their reign, there is
little of note to record till we come to the reign of
Tiernmas, fifth in succession from Eremon. He is said
<pb n='149' id='page149'/>
to have introduced into Ireland the worship of Crom
Cruach, on Moyslaught (The Plain of Adoration<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page85'>p. 85</ref>.
</p></note>), and
to have perished himself with three-fourths of his
people while worshipping this idol on November Eve,
the period when the reign of winter was inaugurated.
Crom Cruach was no doubt a solar deity, but no figure
at all resembling him can be identified among the
Danaan divinities. Tiernmas also, it is said, found the
first gold-mine in Ireland, and introduced variegated
colours into the clothing of the people. A slave might
wear but one colour, a peasant two, a soldier three, a
wealthy landowner four, a provincial chief five, and an
Ollav, or royal person, six. Ollav was a term applied to
a certain Druidic rank; it meant much the same as
<q>doctor,</q> in the sense of a learned man&mdash;a master of
science. It is a characteristic trait that the Ollav is
endowed with a distinction equal to that of a king.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Ollav Fōla</hi>
</p>

<p>
The most distinguished Ollav of Ireland was also a
king, the celebrated Ollav Fōla, who is supposed to
have been eighteenth from Eremon and to have reigned
about 1000 B.C. He was the Lycurgus or Solon of
Ireland, giving to the country a code of legislature,
and also subdividing it, under the High King at Tara,
among the provincial chiefs, to each of whom his proper
rights and obligations were allotted. To Ollav Fōla is
also attributed the foundation of an institution which,
whatever its origin, became of great importance in
Ireland&mdash;the great triennial Fair or Festival at Tara,
where the sub-kings and chiefs, bards, historians, and
musicians from all parts of Ireland assembled to make
up the genealogical records of the clan chieftainships, to
enact laws, hear disputed cases, settle succession, and so
<pb n='150' id='page150'/>
forth; all these political and legislative labours being
lightened by song and feast. It was a stringent law
that at this season all enmities must be laid aside; no
man might lift his hand against another, or even institute
a legal process, while the Assembly at Tara was
in progress. Of all political and national institutions
of this kind Ollav Fōla was regarded as the
traditional founder, just as Goban the Smith was the
founder of artistry and handicraft, and Amergin of
poetry. But whether the Milesian king had any more
objective reality than the other more obviously mythical
figures it is hard to say. He is supposed to have
been buried in the great tumulus at Loughcrew, in
Westmeath.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Kimbay and the Founding of Emain Macha</hi>
</p>

<p>
With Kimbay (<hi rend='italic'>Cimbaoth</hi>), about 300 B.C., we come to
a landmark in history. <q>All the historical records of
the Irish, prior to Kimbay, were dubious</q>&mdash;so, with
remarkable critical acumen for his age, wrote the
eleventh-century historian Tierna of Clonmacnois.<note place='foot'><p>
<q><foreign lang='la'>Omnia monumenta Scotorum ante Cimbaoth incerta erant.</foreign></q>
Tierna, who died in 1088, was Abbot of Clonmacnois, a great monastic
and educational centre in medi&aelig;val Ireland.
</p></note>
There is much that is dubious in those that follow, but
we are certainly on firmer historical ground. With
the reign of Kimbay one great fact emerges into light:
we have the foundation of the kingdom of Ulster at
its centre, Emain Macha, a name redolent to the Irish
student of legendary splendour and heroism. Emain
Macha is now represented by the grassy ramparts of
a great hill-fortress close to Ard Macha (Armagh).
According to one of the derivations offered in Keating's
<q>History of Ireland,</q> <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Emain</foreign> is derived from <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>eo</foreign>, a bodkin,
and <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>muin</foreign>, the neck, the word being thus equivalent to
<pb n='151' id='page151'/>
<q>brooch,</q> and Emain Macha means the Brooch of
Macha. An Irish brooch was a large circular wheel of
gold or bronze, crossed by a long pin, and the great
circular rampart surrounding a Celtic fortress might
well be imaginatively likened to the brooch or a
giantess guarding her cloak, or territory.<note place='foot'><p>
Compare the fine poem of a modern Celtic writer (Sir Samuel
Ferguson), <q>The Widow's Cloak</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the British Empire in the
days of Queen Victoria.
</p></note> The legend
of Macha tells that she was the daughter of Red Hugh,
an Ulster prince who had two brothers, Dithorba and
Kimbay. They agreed to enjoy, each in turn, the
sovranty of Ireland. Red Hugh came first, but on his
death Macha refused to give up the realm and fought
Dithorba for it, whom she conquered and slew. She
then, in equally masterful manner, compelled Kimbay
to wed her, and ruled all Ireland as queen. I give
the rest of the tale in the words of Standish O'Grady:
</p>

<p>
<q>The five sons of Dithorba, having been expelled
out of Ulster, fled across the Shannon, and in the west
of the kingdom plotted against Macha. Then the
Queen went down alone into Connacht and found the
brothers in the forest, where, wearied with the chase,
they were cooking a wild boar which they had slain,
and were carousing before a fire which they had kindled.
She appeared in her grimmest aspect, as the war-goddess,
red all over, terrible and hideous as war itself
but with bright and flashing eyes. One by one the
brothers were inflamed by her sinister beauty, and one
by one she overpowered and bound them. Then she
lifted her burthen of champions upon her back and
returned with them into the north. With the spear of
her brooch she marked out on the plain the circuit of
the city of Emain Macha, whose ramparts and trenches
<pb n='152' id='page152'/>
were constructed by the captive princes, labouring like
slaves under her command.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The underlying idea of all this class of legend,</q>
remarks Mr. O'Grady, <q>is that if men cannot master
war, war will master them; and that those who
aspired to the Ard-Rieship [High-Kingship] of all
Erin must have the war-gods on their side.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Critical History of Ireland,</q> p. 180.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Macha is an instance of the intermingling of the
attributes of the Danaan with the human race of which
I have already spoken.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Laery and Covac</hi>
</p>

<p>
The next king who comes into legendary prominence
is Ugainy the Great, who is said to have ruled not only
all Ireland, but a great part of Western Europe, and to
have wedded a Gaulish princess named Kesair. He
had two sons, Laery and Covac. The former inherited
the kingdom, but Covac, consumed and sick with envy,
sought to slay him, and asked the advice of a Druid
as to how this could be managed, since Laery, justly
suspicious, never would visit him without an armed
escort. The Druid bade him feign death, and have
word sent to his brother that he was on his bier ready
for burial. This Covac did, and when Laery arrived
and bent over the supposed corpse Covac stabbed him
to the heart, and slew also one of his sons, Ailill,<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>El´yill.</q>
</p></note> who
attended him. Then Covac ascended the throne, and
straightway his illness left him.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Legends of Maon, Son of Ailill</hi>
</p>

<p>
He did a brutal deed, however, upon a son of
Ailill's named Maon, about whom a number of legends
<pb n='153' id='page153'/>
cluster. Maon, as a child, was brought into Covac's
presence, and was there compelled, says Keating, to
swallow a portion of his father's and grandfather's
hearts, and also a mouse with her young. From the
disgust he felt, the child lost his speech, and seeing
him dumb, and therefore innocuous, Covac let him go.
The boy was then taken into Munster, to the kingdom
of Feramorc, of which Scoriath was king, and remained
with him some time, but afterwards went to Gaul, his
great-grandmother Kesair's country, where his guards
told the king that he was heir to the throne of Ireland,
and he was treated with great honour and grew up into
a noble youth. But he left behind him in the heart of
Moriath, daughter of the King of Feramorc, a passion
that could not be stilled, and she resolved to bring him
back to Ireland. She accordingly equipped her father's
harper, Craftiny, with many rich gifts, and wrote for
him a love-lay, in which her passion for Maon was set
forth, and to which Craftiny composed an enchanting
melody. Arrived in France, Craftiny made his way to
the king's court, and found occasion to pour out his lay
to Maon. So deeply stirred was he by the beauty and
passion of the song that his speech returned to him
and he broke out into praises of it, and was thenceforth
dumb no more. The King of Gaul then equipped him
with an armed force and sent him to Ireland to regain
his kingdom. Learning that Covac was at a place near
at hand named Dinrigh, Maon and his body of Gauls
made a sudden attack upon him and slew him there
and then, with all his nobles and guards. After the
slaughter a Druid of Covac's company asked one of
the Gauls who their leader was. <q>The Mariner</q>
(<hi rend='italic'>Loingseach</hi>), replied the Gaul, meaning the captain of
the fleet&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Maon. <q>Can he speak?</q> inquired the
Druid, who had begun to suspect the truth. <q>He
<pb n='154' id='page154'/>
does speak</q> (<hi rend='italic'>Labraidh</hi>), said the man; and henceforth
the name <q>Labra the Mariner</q> clung to Maon son of
Ailill, nor was he known by any other. He then
sought out Moriath, wedded her, and reigned over
Ireland ten years.
</p>

<p>
From this invasion of the Gauls the name of the
province of Leinster is traditionally derived. They were
armed with spears having broad blue-green iron heads
called <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>laighne</foreign> (pronounced <q>lyna</q>), and as they were
allotted lands in Leinster and settled there, the province
was called in Irish <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Laighin</foreign> (<q>Ly-in</q>) after them&mdash;the
Province of the Spearmen.<note place='foot'><p>
The ending <hi rend='italic'>ster</hi> in three of the names of the Irish provinces is
of Norse origin, and is a relic of the Viking conquests in Ireland.
Connacht, where the Vikings did not penetrate, alone preserves its
Irish name unmodified. Ulster (in Irish <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Ulaidh</foreign>) is supposed to
derive its name from Ollav Fōla, Munster (<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Mumhan</foreign>) from King

</p>

<p>
Of Labra the Mariner, after his accession, a curious
tale is told. He was accustomed, it is said, to have his
hair cropped but once a year, and the man to do this
was chosen by lot, and was immediately afterwards put
to death. The reason of this was that, like King Midas
in the similar Greek myth, he had long ears like those
of a horse, and he would not have this deformity known.
Once it fell, however, that the person chosen to crop
his hair was the only son of a poor widow, by whose
tears and entreaties the king was prevailed upon to let
him live, on condition that he swore by the Wind and
Sun to tell no man what he might see. The oath was
taken, and the young man returned to his mother. But
by-and-by the secret so preyed on his mind that he fell
into a sore sickness, and was near to death, when a wise
Druid was called in to heal him. <q>It is the secret that
<pb n='155' id='page155'/>
is killing him,</q> said the Druid, <q>and he will never be
well till he reveals it. Let him therefore go along the
high-road till he come to a place where four roads meet.
Let him there turn to the right, and the first tree he
shall meet on the road, let him tell his secret to that,
and he shall be rid of it, and recover.</q> So the youth
did; and the first tree was a willow. He laid his lips
close to the bark, whispered his secret to it, and went
home, light-hearted as of old. But it chanced that
shortly after this the harper Craftiny broke his harp and
needed a new one, and as luck would have it the first
suitable tree he came to was the willow that had the
king's secret. He cut it down, made his harp from it,
and performed that night as usual in the king's hall;
when, to the amazement of all, as soon as the harper
touched the strings the assembled guests heard them
chime the words, <q>Two horse's ears hath Labra the
Mariner.</q> The king then, seeing that the secret was
out, plucked off his hood and showed himself plainly;
nor was any man put to death again on account of this
mystery. We have seen that the compelling power of
Craftiny's music had formerly cured Labra's dumbness.
The sense of something magical in music, as though
supernatural powers spoke through it, is of constant
recurrence in Irish legend.

<hi rend='bold'>Legend-Cycle of Conary Mōr</hi>
</p>

<p>
We now come to a cycle of legends centering on, or
rather closing with, the wonderful figure of the High
King Conary Mōr&mdash;a cycle so charged with splendour,
mystery, and romance that to do it justice would require
far more space than can be given to it within the limits
of this work.<note place='foot'><p>
The reader may, however, be referred to the tale of Etain and
Midir as given in full by A.H. Leahy (<q>Heroic Romances of
Ireland</q>), and by the writer in his <q>High Deeds of Finn,</q> and to
the tale of Conary rendered by Sir S. Ferguson (<q>Poems,</q> 1886), in
what Dr. Whitley Stokes has described as the noblest poem ever
written by an Irishman.
</p></note>
</p>

<pb n='156' id='page156'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Etain in Fairyland</hi>
</p>

<p>
The preliminary events of the cycle are transacted
in the <q>Land of Youth,</q> the mystic country of the
People of Dana after their dispossession by the Children
of Miled. Midir the Proud son of the Dagda, a Danaan
prince dwelling on Slieve Callary, had a wife named
Fuamnach. After a while he took to himself another
bride, Etain, whose beauty and grace were beyond
compare, so that <q>as fair as Etain</q> became a proverbial
comparison for any beauty that exceeded all other
standards. Fuamnach therefore became jealous of her
rival, and having by magic art changed her into a
butterfly, she raised a tempest that drove her forth from
the palace, and kept her for seven years buffeted hither
and thither throughout the length and breadth of Erin.
At last, however, a chance gust of wind blew her through
a window of the fairy palace of Angus on the Boyne.
The immortals cannot be hidden from each other, and
Angus knew what she was. Unable to release her
altogether from the spell of Fuamnach, he made a sunny
bower for her, and planted round it all manner of
choice and honey-laden flowers, on which she lived as
long as she was with him, while in the secrecy of the
night he restored her to her own form and enjoyed her
love. In time, however, her refuge was discovered by
Fuamnach; again the magic tempest descended upon
her and drove her forth; and this time a singular fate
was hers. Blown into the palace of an Ulster chieftain
named Etar, she fell into the drinking-cup of Etar's
wife just as the latter was about to drink. She was
swallowed in the draught, and in due time, having
<pb n='157' id='page157'/>
passed into the womb of Etar's wife, she was born as
an apparently mortal child, and grew up to maidenhood
knowing nothing of her real nature and ancestry.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Eochy and Etain</hi>
</p>

<p>
About this time it happened that the High King of
Ireland, Eochy,<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Yeo´hee.</q>
</p></note> being wifeless and urged by the nobles
of his land to take a queen&mdash;<q>for without thou do
so,</q> they said, <q>we will not bring our wives to the
Assembly at Tara</q>&mdash;sent forth to inquire for a fair and
noble maiden to share his throne. The messengers
report that Etain, daughter of Etar, is the fairest maiden
in Ireland, and the king journeys forth to visit her. A
piece of description here follows which is one of the
most highly wrought and splendid in Celtic or perhaps
in any literature. Eochy finds Etain with her maidens
by a spring of water, whither she had gone forth to
wash her hair:
</p>

<p>
<q>A clear comb of silver was held in her hand, the
comb was adorned with gold; and near her, as for
washing, was a bason of silver whereon four birds had
been chased, and there were little bright gems of
carbuncles on the rims of the bason. A bright purple
mantle waved round her; and beneath it was another
mantle ornamented with silver fringes: the outer
mantle was clasped over her bosom with a golden
brooch. A tunic she wore with a long hood that
might cover her head attached to it; it was stiff and
glossy with green silk beneath red embroidery of gold,
and was clasped over her breasts with marvellously
wrought clasps of silver and gold; so that men saw
the bright gold and the green silk flashing against the
sun. On her head were two tresses of golden hair,
<pb n='158' id='page158'/>
and each tress had been plaited into four strands; at
the end of each strand was a little ball of gold. And
there was that maiden undoing her hair that she might
wash it, her two arms out through the armholes of her
smock. Each of her two arms was as white as the
snow of a single night, and each of her cheeks was as
rosy as the foxglove. Even and small were the teeth
in her head, and they shone like pearls. Her eyes
were as blue as a hyacinth, her lips delicate and
crimson; very high, soft and white were her shoulders.
Tender, polished and white were her wrists; her
fingers long and of great whiteness; her nails were
beautiful and pink. White as snow, or the foam of a
wave, was her neck; long was it, slender, and as soft as
silk. Smooth and white were her thighs; her knees
were round and firm and white; her ankles were as
straight as the rule of a carpenter. Her feet were slim
and as white as the ocean's foam; evenly set were her
eyes; her eyebrows were of a bluish black, such as you
see upon the shell of a beetle. Never a maid fairer
than she, or more worthy of love, was till then seen by
the eyes of men; and it seemed to them that she must
be one of those that have come from the fairy mounds.</q><note place='foot'><p>
I quote Mr. A.H. Leahy's translation from a fifteenth-century
Egerton manuscript (<q>Heroic Romances of Ireland,</q> vol. i. p. 12).
The story is, however, found in much more ancient authorities.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
The king wooed her and made her his wife, and
brought her back to Tara.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Love-Story of Ailill</hi>
</p>

<p>
It happened that the king had a brother named
Ailill, who, on seeing Etain, was so smitten with her
beauty that he fell sick of the intensity of his passion
and wasted almost to death. While he was in
this condition Eochy had to make a royal progress
<pb n='159' id='page159'/>
through Ireland. He left his brother&mdash;the cause of
whose malady none suspected&mdash;in Etain's care, bidding
her do what she could for him, and, if he died, to bury
him with due ceremonies and erect an Ogham stone
above his grave.<note place='foot'><p>
Ogham letters, which were composed of straight lines arranged
in a certain order about the axis formed by the edge of a squared
pillar-stone, were used for sepulchral inscription and writing
generally before the introduction of the Roman alphabet in Ireland.
</p></note> Etain goes to visit the brother; she
inquires the cause of his illness; he speaks to her in
enigmas, but at last, moved beyond control by her
tenderness, he breaks out in an avowal of his passion.
His description of the yearning of hopeless love is a
lyric of extraordinary intensity. <q>It is closer than the
skin,</q> he cries, <q>it is like a battle with a spectre, it
overwhelms like a flood, it is a weapon under the sea,
it is a passion for an echo.</q> By <q>a weapon under the
sea</q> the poet means that love is like one of the secret
treasures of the fairy-folk in the kingdom of Mananan&mdash;as
wonderful and as unattainable.
</p>

<p>
Etain is now in some perplexity; but she decides,
with a kind of naïve good-nature, that although she is
not in the least in love with Ailill, she cannot see a
man die of longing for her, and she promises to be
his. Possibly we are to understand here that she was
prompted by the fairy nature, ignorant of good and
evil, and alive only to pleasure and to suffering. It
must be said, however, that in the Irish myths in
general this, as we may call it, <q>fairy</q> view of morality
is the one generally prevalent both among Danaans and
mortals&mdash;both alike strike one as morally irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
Etain now arranges a tryst with Ailill in a house
outside of Tara&mdash;for she will not do what she calls her
<q>glorious crime</q> in the king's palace. But Ailill on
the eve of the appointed day falls into a profound
<pb n='160' id='page160'/>
slumber and misses his appointment. A being in his
shape does, however, come to Etain, but merely to
speak coldly and sorrowfully of his malady, and departs
again. When the two meet once more the situation
is altogether changed. In Ailill's enchanted sleep his
unholy passion for the queen has passed entirely away.
Etain, on the other hand, becomes aware that behind the
visible events there are mysteries which she does not
understand.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Midir the Proud</hi>
</p>

<p>
The explanation soon follows. The being who came
to her in the shape of Ailill was her Danaan husband,
Midir the Proud. He now comes to woo her in his true
shape, beautiful and nobly apparelled, and entreats her
to fly with him to the Land of Youth, where she can
be safe henceforward, since her persecutor, Fuamnach,
is dead. He it was who shed upon Ailill's eyes the
magic slumber. His description of the fairyland to
which he invites her is given in verses of great
beauty:
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Land of Youth</hi>
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>O fair-haired woman, will you come with me to the marvellous
land, full of music, where the hair is primrose-yellow
and the body white as snow?</q></l>
<l><q rend='pre: none; post: none'>There none speaks of <q>mine</q> or <q>thine</q>&mdash;white are the
teeth and black the brows; eyes flash with many-coloured
lights, and the hue of the foxglove is on every cheek.</q></l>
<l>Pleasant to the eye are the plains of Erin, but they are a 
desert to the Great Plain.</l>
<l>Heady is the ale of Erin, but the ale of the Great Plain is 
headier.</l>
<l>It is one of the wonders of that land that youth does not 
change into age.</l>
<l>Smooth and sweet are the streams that flow through it;
mead and wine abound of every kind; there men are
<pb n='161' id='page161'/>
all fair, without blemish; there women conceive without sin.</l>
<l>We see around us on every side, yet no man seeth us; the
cloud of the sin of Adam hides us from their observation.</l>
<l><q rend='post: none'>O lady, if thou wilt come to my strong people, the purest
of gold shall be on thy head&mdash;thy meat shall be swine's
flesh unsalted,<note place='foot'><p>
The reference is to the magic swine of Mananan, which were
killed and eaten afresh every day, and whose meat preserved the
eternal youth of the People of Dana.
</p></note> new milk and mead shall thou drink
with me there, O fair-haired woman.<corr sic='&rsquo;'></corr></q></l>
</lg>

<p>
I have given this remarkable lyric at length because,
though Christian and ascetic ideas are obviously
discernible in it, it represents on the whole the pagan
and mythical conception of the Land of Youth, the
country of the Dead.
</p>

<p>
Etain, however, is by no means ready to go away
with a stranger and to desert the High King for a man
<q>without name or lineage.</q> Midir tells her who he
is, and all her own history of which, in her present
incarnation, she knows nothing; and he adds that it
was one thousand and twelve years from Etain's birth
in the Land of Youth till she was born a mortal child
to the wife of Etar. Ultimately Etain agrees to return
with Midir to her ancient home, but only on condition
that the king will agree to their severance, and with
this Midir has to be content for the time.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>A Game of Chess</hi>
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards he appears to King Eochy, as
already related,<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page124'>p. 124</ref>.
</p></note> on the Hill of Tara. He tells the
king that he has come to play a game of chess with
him, and produces a chessboard of silver with pieces of
gold studded with jewels. To be a skilful chess-player
was a necessary accomplishment of kings and nobles in
<pb n='162' id='page162'/>
Ireland, and Eochy enters into the game with zest.
Midir allows him to win game after game, and in payment
for his losses he performs by magic all kinds of
tasks for Eochy, reclaiming land, clearing forests, and
building causeways across bogs&mdash;here we have a touch
of the popular conception of the Danaans as earth
deities associated with agriculture and fertility. At
last, having excited Eochy's cupidity and made him
believe himself the better player, he proposes a final
game, the stakes to be at the pleasure of the victor
after the game is over. Eochy is now defeated.
</p>

<p>
<q>My stake is forfeit to thee,</q> said Eochy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Had I wished it, it had been forfeit long ago,</q>
said Midir.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it that thou desirest me to grant?</q> said
Eochy.
</p>

<p>
<q>That I may hold Etain in my arms and obtain a
kiss from her,</q> said Midir.
</p>

<p>
The king was silent for a while; then he said: <q>One
month from to-day thou shalt come, and the thing thou
desirest shall be granted thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Midir and Etain</hi>
</p>

<p>
Eochy's mind foreboded evil, and when the appointed
day came he caused the palace of Tara to be surrounded
by a great host of armed men to keep Midir
out. All was in vain, however; as the king sat at the
feast, while Etain handed round the wine, Midir, more
glorious than ever, suddenly stood in their midst.
Holding his spears in his left hand, he threw his right
around Etain, and the couple rose lightly in the air
and disappeared through a roof-window in the palace.
Angry and bewildered, the king and his warriors rushed
out of doors, but all they could see was two white
swans that circled in the air above the palace, and then
<pb n='163' id='page163'/>
departed in long, steady flight towards the fairy mountain
of Slievenamon. And thus Queen Etain rejoined
her kindred.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>War with Fairyland</hi>
</p>

<p>
Eochy, however, would not accept defeat, and now
ensues what I think is the earliest recorded war with
Fairyland since the first dispossession of the Danaans.
After searching Ireland for his wife in vain, he summoned
to his aid the Druid Dalan. Dalan tried for a
year by every means in his power to find out where she
was. At last he made what seems to have been an
operation of wizardry of special strength&mdash;<q>he made
three wands of yew, and upon the wands he wrote an
ogham; and by the keys of wisdom that he had, and
by the ogham, it was revealed to him that Etain was in
the fairy mound of Bri-Leith, and that Midir had borne
her thither.</q>
</p>

<p>
Eochy then assembled his forces to storm and
destroy the fairy mound in which was the palace of
Midir. It is said that he was nine years digging up
one mound after another, while Midir and his folk
repaired the devastation as fast as it was made. At
last Midir, driven to the last stronghold, attempted a
stratagem&mdash;he offered to give up Etain, and sent her
with fifty handmaids to the king, but made them all so
much alike that Eochy could not distinguish the true
Etain from her images. She herself, it is said, gave
him a sign by which to know her. The motive of the
tale, including the choice of the mortal rather than the
god, reminds one of the beautiful Hindu legend of
Damayanti and Nala. Eochy regained his queen, who
lived with him till his death, ten years afterwards, and
bore him one daughter, who was named Etain, like
herself.
</p>

<pb n='164' id='page164'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tale of Conary Mōr</hi>
</p>

<p>
From this Etain ultimately sprang the great king
Conary Mōr, who shines in Irish legend as the supreme
type of royal splendour, power, and beneficence, and
whose overthrow and death were compassed by the
Danaans in vengeance for the devastation of their sacred
dwellings by Eochy. The tale in which the death of
Conary is related is one of the most antique and
barbaric in conception of all Irish legends, but it has
a magnificence of imagination which no other can rival.
To this great story the tale of Etain and Midir may be
regarded as what the Irish called a <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>priomscel</foreign>, <q>introductory
tale,</q> showing the more remote origin of the
events related. The genealogy of Conary Mōr will
help the reader to understand the connexion of events.

<hi rend='bold'>The Law of the Geis</hi>
</p>

<p>
The tale of Conary introduces us for the first time
to the law or institution of the <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign>, which plays henceforward
a very important part in Irish legend, the
violation or observance of a <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign> being frequently the
turning-point in a tragic narrative. We must therefore
delay a moment to explain to the reader exactly
what this peculiar institution was.
</p>

<p>
Dineen's <q>Irish Dictionary</q> explains the word <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign>
<pb n='165' id='page165'/>
(pronounced <q>gaysh</q>&mdash;plural, <q>gaysha</q>) as meaning
<q>a bond, a spell, a prohibition, a taboo, a magical
injunction, the violation of which led to misfortune and
death.</q><note place='foot'><p>
The meaning quoted will be found in the Dictionary under the
alternative form <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geas</foreign>
</p></note> Every Irish chieftain or personage of note
had certain <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> peculiar to himself which he must not
transgress. These <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> had sometimes reference to a
code of chivalry&mdash;thus Dermot of the Love-spot, when
appealed to by Grania to take her away from Finn, is
under <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> not to refuse protection to a woman. Or they
may be merely superstitious or fantastic&mdash;thus Conary,
as one of his <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign>, is forbidden to follow three red horsemen
on a road, nor must he kill birds (this is because, as
we shall see, his totem was a bird). It is a <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign> to the
Ulster champion, Fergus mac Roy, that he must not
refuse an invitation to a feast; on this turns the Tragedy
of the Sons of Usnach. It is not at all clear who imposed
these <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> or how any one found out what his personal
<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> were&mdash;all that was doubtless an affair of the
Druids. But they were regarded as sacred obligations,
and the worst misfortunes were to be apprehended from
breaking them. Originally, no doubt, they were regarded
as a means of keeping oneself in proper relations
with the other world&mdash;the world of Faëry&mdash;and were
akin to the well-known Polynesian practice of the
<q>tabu.</q> I prefer, however, to retain the Irish word
as the only fitting one for the Irish practice.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Cowherd's Fosterling</hi>
</p>

<p>
We now return to follow the fortunes of Etain's
great-grandson, Conary. Her daughter, Etain Oig, as
we have seen from the genealogical table, married
Cormac, King of Ulster. She bore her husband no
children save one daughter only. Embittered by her
<pb n='166' id='page166'/>
barrenness and his want of an heir, the king put away
Etain, and ordered her infant to be abandoned and
thrown into a pit. <q>Then his two thralls take her to a
pit, and she smiles a laughing smile at them as they were
putting her into it.</q><note place='foot'><p>
I quote from Whitley Stokes' translation, <title rend='italic'>Revue Celtique</title>, January
1901, and succeeding numbers.
</p></note> After that they cannot leave her
to die, and they carry her to a cowherd of Eterskel,
King of Tara, by whom she is fostered and taught <q>till
she became a good embroidress and there was not in
Ireland a king's daughter dearer than she.</q> Hence the
name she bore, Messbuachalla (<q>Messboo´hala</q>), which
means <q>the cowherd's foster-child.</q>
</p>

<p>
For fear of her being discovered, the cowherds keep
the maiden in a house of wickerwork having only a
roof-opening. But one of King Eterskel's folk has the
curiosity to climb up and look in, and sees there the
fairest maiden in Ireland. He bears word to the king,
who orders an opening to be made in the wall and the
maiden fetched forth, for the king was childless, and
it had been prophesied to him by his Druid that a
woman of unknown race would bear him a son. Then
said the king: <q>This is the woman that has been
prophesied to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Parentage and Birth of Conary</hi>
</p>

<p>
Before her release, however, she is visited by a
denizen from the Land of Youth. A great bird comes
down through her roof-window. On the floor of the
hut his bird-plumage falls from him and reveals a
glorious youth. Like Danaë, like Leda, like Ethlinn
daughter of Balor, she gives her love to the god. Ere
they part he tells her that she will be taken to the
king, but that she will bear to her Danaan lover a son
<pb n='167' id='page167'/>
whose name shall be Conary, and that it shall be
forbidden to him to go a-hunting after birds.
</p>

<p>
So Conary was born, and grew up into a wise and
noble youth, and he was fostered with a lord named
Desa, whose three great-grandsons grew up with him
from childhood. Their names were Ferlee and Fergar
and Ferrogan; and Conary, it is said, loved them well
and taught them his wisdom.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Conary the High King</hi>
</p>

<p>
Then King Eterskel died, and a successor had to be
appointed. In Ireland the eldest son did not succeed
to the throne or chieftaincy as a matter of right, but
the ablest and best of the family at the time was
supposed to be selected by the clan. In this tale we
have a curious account of this selection by means of
divination. A <q>bull-feast</q> was held&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, a bull was
slain, and the diviner would <q>eat his fill and drink its
broth</q>; then he went to bed, where a truth-compelling
spell was chanted over him. Whoever he saw in his
dream would be king. So at Ægira, in Ach&aelig;a, as Whitley
Stokes points out, the priestess of Earth drank the fresh
blood of a bull before descending into the cave to prophesy.
The dreamer cried in his sleep that he saw a
naked man going towards Tara with a stone in his sling.
</p>

<p>
The bull-feast was held at Tara, but Conary was
then with his three foster-brothers playing a game on
the Plains of Liffey. They separated, Conary going
towards Dublin, where he saw before him a flock of
great birds, wonderful in colour and beauty. He drove
after them in his chariot, but the birds would go a
spear-cast in front and light, and fly on again, never
letting him come up with them till they reached the
sea-shore. Then he lighted down from his chariot and
took out his sling to cast at them, whereupon they
<pb n='168' id='page168'/>
changed into armed men and turned on him with
spears and swords. One of them, however, protected
him, and said: <q>I am Nemglan, king of thy father's
birds; and thou hast been forbidden to cast at birds,
for here there is no one but is thy kin.</q> <q>Till to-day,</q>
said Conary, <q>I knew not this.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Go to Tara to-night,</q> said Nemglan; <q>the bull-feast
is there, and through it thou shalt be made king.
A man stark naked, who shall go at the end of the
night along one of the roads to Tara, having a stone
and a sling&mdash;'tis he that shall be king.</q>
</p>

<p>
So Conary stripped off his raiment and went naked
through the night to Tara, where all the roads were
being watched by chiefs having changes of royal raiment
with them to clothe the man who should come according
to the prophecy. When Conary meets them they
clothe him and bring him in, and he is proclaimed
King of Erin.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Conary's Geise</hi>
</p>

<p>
A long list of his <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> is here given, which are said
to have been declared to him by Nemglan. <q>The
bird-reign shall be noble,</q> said he, <q rend='post: none'>and these shall be

</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Thou shalt not go right-handwise round Tara, nor left-handwise

<l rend='margin-left: 1'>Thou shalt not hunt the evil-beasts of Cerna,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>Thou shalt not go out every ninth night beyond Tara.</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>Thou shalt not sleep in a house from which firelight shows

</lg>

<p>
Conary then entered upon his reign, which was
marked by the fair seasons and bounteous harvests
always associated in the Irish mind with the reign
of a good king. Foreign ships came to the ports.
Oak-mast for the swine was up to the knees every
autumn; the rivers swarmed with fish. <q>No one slew
another in Erin during his reign, and to every one in
Erin his fellow's voice seemed as sweet as the strings of
lutes. From mid-spring to mid-autumn no wind disturbed
a cow's tail.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Beginning of the Vengeance</hi>
</p>

<p>
Disturbance, however, came from another source.
Conary had put down all raiding and rapine, and his
three foster-brothers, who were born reavers, took it ill.
They pursued their evil ways in pride and wilfulness, and
were at last captured red-handed. Conary would not
condemn them to death, as the people begged him to do,
but spared them for the sake of his kinship in fosterage.
They were, however, banished from Erin and bidden
to go raiding overseas, if raid they must. On the seas
they met another exiled chief, Ingcel the One-Eyed, son
of the King of Britain, and joining forces with him they
attacked the fortress in which Ingcel's father, mother, and
brothers were guests at the time, and all were destroyed
in a single night. It was then the turn of Ingcel to ask
their help in raiding the land of Erin, and gathering a
host of other outlawed men, including the seven Manés,
sons of Ailell and Maev of Connacht, besides Ferlee,
Fergar, and Ferrogan, they made a descent upon Ireland,
taking land on the Dublin coast near Howth.
</p>

<pb n='170' id='page170'/>

<p>
Meantime Conary had been lured by the machinations
of the Danaans into breaking one after another of
his <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign>. He settles a quarrel between two of his serfs
in Munster, and travelling back to Tara they see the
country around it lit with the glare of fires and wrapped
in clouds of smoke. A host from the North, they
think, must be raiding the country, and to escape it
Conary's company have to turn right-handwise round
Tara and then left-handwise round the Plain of Bregia.
But the smoke and flames were an illusion made by the
Fairy Folk, who are now drawing the toils closer round
the doomed king. On his way past Bregia he chases
<q>the evil beasts of Cerna</q>&mdash;whatever they were&mdash;<q>but
he saw it not till the chase was ended.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Da Derga's Hostel and the Three Reds</hi>
</p>

<p>
Conary had now to find a resting-place for the night,
and he recollects that he is not far from the Hostel of
the Leinster lord, Da Derga, which gives its name to
this bardic tale.<note place='foot'><p>
<q>The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel.</q>
</p></note> Conary had been generous to him
when Da Derga came visiting to Tara, and he determined
to seek his hospitality for the night. Da Derga dwelt
in a vast hall with seven doors near to the present town
of Dublin, probably at Donnybrook, on the high-road to
the south. As the cavalcade are journeying thither an
ominous incident occurs&mdash;Conary marks in front of them
on the road three horsemen clad all in red and riding
on red horses. He remembers his <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign> about the <q>three
Reds,</q> and sends a messenger forward to bid them fall
behind. But however the messenger lashes his horse
he fails to get nearer than the length of a spear-cast
to the three Red Riders. He shouts to them to turn
back and follow the king, but one of them, looking over
his shoulder, bids him ironically look out for <q>great
<pb n='171' id='page171'/>
news from a Hostel.</q> Again and again the messenger
is sent to them with promises of great reward if they
will fall behind instead of preceding Conary. At last
one of them chants a mystic and terrible strain. <q>Lo,
my son, great the news. Weary are the steeds we ride
&mdash;the steeds from the fairy mounds. Though we are
living, we are dead. Great are the signs: destruction
of life; sating of ravens; feeding of crows; strife of
slaughter; wetting of sword-edge; shields with broken
bosses after sundown. Lo, my son!</q> Then they ride
forward, and, alighting from their red steeds, fasten them
at the portal of Da Derga's Hostel and sit down inside.
<q>Derga,</q> it may be explained, means <q>red.</q> Conary
had therefore been preceded by three red horsemen to
the House of Red. <q>All my <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign>,</q> he remarks forebodingly,
<q>have seized me to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Gathering of the Hosts</hi>
</p>

<p>
From this point the story of Conary Mōr takes on
a character of supernatural vastness and mystery, the
imagination of the bardic narrator dilating, as it were,
with the approach of the crisis. Night has fallen, and
the pirate host of Ingcel is encamped on the shores of
Dublin Bay. They hear the noise of the royal cavalcade,
and a long-sighted messenger is sent out to discover what
it is. He brings back word of the glittering and multitudinous
host which has followed Conary to the Hostel.
A crashing noise is heard&mdash;Ingcel asks of Ferrogan
what it may be&mdash;it is the giant warrior mac Cecht striking
flint on steel to kindle fire for the king's feast. <q>God
send that Conary be not there to-night,</q> cry the sons of
Desa; <q>woe that he should be under the hurt of his
foes.</q> But Ingcel reminds them of their compact&mdash;he
had given them the plundering of his own father
and brethren; they cannot refuse to stand by him in the
<pb n='172' id='page172'/>
attack he meditates on Conary in the Hostel. A glare
of the fire lit by mac Cecht is now perceived by the
pirate host, shining through the wheels of the chariots
which are drawn up around the open doors of the Hostel.
Another of the <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> of Conary has been broken.
</p>

<p>
Ingcel and his host now proceed to build a great cairn
of stones, each man contributing one stone, so that there
may be a memorial of the fight, and also a record of
the number slain when each survivor removes his stone
again.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Morrigan</hi>
</p>

<p>
The scene now shifts to the Hostel, where the king's
party has arrived and is preparing for the night. A
solitary woman comes to the door and seeks admission.
<q>As long as a weaver's beam were each of her two shins,
and they were as dark as the back of a stag-beetle. A
greyish, woolly mantle she wore. Her hair reached to
her knee. Her mouth was twisted to one side of her
head.</q> It was the Morrigan, the Danaan goddess of
Death and Destruction. She leant against the doorpost
of the house and looked evilly on the king and his
company. <q>Well, O woman,</q> said Conary, <q>if thou
art a witch, what seest thou for us?</q> <q>Truly I see
for thee,</q> she answered, <q>that neither fell nor flesh of
thine shall escape from the place into which thou hast
come, save what birds will bear away in their claws.</q>
She asks admission. Conary declares that his <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign>
forbids him to receive a solitary man or woman after
sunset. <q>If in sooth,</q> she says, <q>it has befallen the
king not to have room in his house for the meal and
bed of a solitary woman, they will be gotten apart
from him from some one possessing generosity.</q> <q>Let
her in, then,</q> says Conary, <q>though it is a <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign> of
mine.</q>
</p>

<pb n='173' id='page173'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Conary and his Retinue</hi>
</p>

<p>
A lengthy and brilliant passage now follows describing
how Ingcel goes to spy out the state of affairs in
the Hostel. Peeping through the chariot-wheels, he
takes note of all he sees, and describes to the sons of
Desa the appearance and equipment of each prince and
mighty man in Conary's retinue, while Ferrogan and
his brother declare who he is and what destruction he
will work in the coming fight. There is Cormac, son
of Conor, King of Ulster, the fair and good; there are
three huge, black and black-robed warriors of the
Picts; there is Conary's steward, with bristling hair,
who settles every dispute&mdash;a needle would be heard
falling when he raises his voice to speak, and he bears
a staff of office the size of a mill-shaft; there is the
warrior mac Cecht, who lies supine with his knees
drawn up&mdash;they resemble two bare hills, his eyes are
like lakes, his nose a mountain-peak, his sword shines
like a river in the sun. Conary's three sons are there,
golden-haired, silk-robed, beloved of all the household,
with <q>manners of ripe maidens, and hearts of brothers,
and valour of bears.</q> When Ferrogan hears of them
he weeps and cannot proceed till hours of the night
have passed. Three Fomorian hostages of horrible
aspect are there also; and Conall of the Victories with
his blood-red shield; and Duftach of Ulster with
his magic spear, which, when there is a premonition
of battle, must be kept in a brew of soporific
herbs, or it will flame on its haft and fly forth raging
for massacre; and three giants from the Isle of Man
with horses' manes reaching to their heels. A strange
and unearthly touch is introduced by a description of
three naked and bleeding forms hanging by ropes from
the roof&mdash;they are the daughters of the Bav, another
<pb n='174' id='page174'/>
name for the Morrigan, or war-goddess, <q>three of
awful boding,</q> says the tale enigmatically, <q>those are
the three that are slaughtered at every time.</q> We
are probably to regard them as visionary beings, portending
war and death, visible only to Ingcel. The
hall with its separate chambers is full of warriors, cup-bearers,
musicians playing, and jugglers doing wonderful
feats; and Da Derga with his attendants dispensing
food and drink. Conary himself is described as a youth;
<q>the ardour and energy of a king has he and the
counsel of a sage; the mantle I saw round him is even
as the mist of May-day&mdash;lovelier in each hue of it than
the other.</q> His golden-hilted sword lies beside him&mdash;a
forearm's length of it has escaped from the
scabbard, shining like a beam of light. <q>He is the
mildest and gentlest and most perfect king that has
come into the world, even Conary son of Eterskel ...
great is the tenderness of the sleepy, simple man till
he has chanced on a deed of valour. But if his fury
and his courage are awakened when the champions of
Erin and Alba are at him in the house, the Destruction
will not be wrought so long as he is therein ... sad
were the quenching of that reign.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Champions at the House</hi>
</p>

<p>
Ingcel and the sons of Desa then march to the attack
and surround the Hostel:
</p>

<p>
<q>Silence a while!</q> says Conary, <q>what is this?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Champions at the house,</q> says Conall of the Victories.
</p>

<p>
<q>There are warriors for them here,</q> answers Conary.
</p>

<p>
<q>They will be needed to-night,</q> Conall rejoins.
</p>

<p>
One of Desa's sons rushes first into the Hostel. His
head is struck off and cast out of it again. Then the
great struggle begins. The Hostel is set on fire, but
<pb n='175' id='page175'/>
the fire is quenched with wine or any liquids that are
in it. Conary and his people sally forth&mdash;hundreds
are slain, and the reavers, for the moment, are routed.
But Conary, who has done prodigies of fighting, is athirst
and can do no more till he gets water. The reavers by
advice of their wizards have cut off the river Dodder,
which flowed through the Hostel, and all the liquids in
the house had been spilt on the fires.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Death of Conary</hi>
</p>

<p>
The king, who is perishing of thirst, asks mac Cecht
to procure him a drink, and mac Cecht turns to Conall
and asks him whether he will get the drink for the
king or stay to protect him while mac Cecht does it.
<q>Leave the defence of the king to us,</q> says Conall,
<q>and go thou to seek the drink, for of thee it is
demanded.</q> Mac Cecht then, taking Conary's golden
cup, rushes forth, bursting through the surrounding
host, and goes to seek for water. Then Conall, and
Cormac of Ulster, and the other champions, issue forth
in turn, slaying multitudes of the enemy; some return
wounded and weary to the little band in the Hostel,
while others cut their way through the ring of
foes. Conall, Sencha, and Duftach stand by Conary
till the end; but mac Cecht is long in returning,
Conary perishes of thirst, and the three heroes then
fight their way out and escape, <q>wounded, broken, and
maimed.</q>
</p>

<p>
Meantime mac Cecht has rushed over Ireland in
frantic search for the water. But the Fairy Folk, who
are here manifestly elemental powers controlling the
forces of nature, have sealed all the sources against him.
He tries the Well of Kesair in Wicklow in vain; he goes
to the great rivers, Shannon and Slayney, Bann and
Barrow&mdash;they all hide away at his approach; the lakes
<pb n='176' id='page176'/>
deny him also; at last he finds a lake, Loch Gara in
Roscommon, which failed to hide itself in time, and
thereat he fills his cup. In the morning he returned
to the Hostel with the precious and hard-won draught,
but found the defenders all dead or fled, and two of
the reavers in the act of striking off the head of Conary.
Mac Cecht struck off the head of one of them, and
hurled a huge pillar stone after the other, who was
escaping with Conary's head. The reaver fell dead on
the spot, and mac Cecht, taking up his master's head,
poured the water into its mouth. Thereupon the head
spoke, and praised and thanked him for the deed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Mac Cecht's Wound</hi>
</p>

<p>
A woman then came by and saw mac Cecht lying
exhausted and wounded on the field.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come hither, O woman,</q> says mac Cecht.
</p>

<p>
<q>I dare not go there,</q> says the woman, <q>for horror
and fear of thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
But he persuades her to come, and says: <q>I know
not whether it is a fly or gnat or an ant that nips me
in the wound.</q>
</p>

<p>
The woman looked and saw a hairy wolf buried as
far as the two shoulders in the wound. She seized it
by the tail and dragged it forth, and it took <q>the full
of its jaws out of him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Truly,</q> says the woman, <q>this is an ant of the
Ancient Land.</q>
</p>

<p>
And mac Cecht took it by the throat and smote it on
the forehead, so that it died.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'><q>Is thy Lord Alive?</q></hi>
</p>

<p>
The tale ends in a truly heroic strain. Conall of the
Victories, as we have seen, had cut his way out after
the king's death, and made his way to Teltin, where he
<pb n='177' id='page177'/>
found his father, Amorgin, in the garth before his
dūn. Conall's shield-arm had been wounded by thrice
fifty spears, and he reached Teltin now with half a
shield, and his sword, and the fragments of his two
spears.
</p>

<p>
<q>Swift are the wolves that have hunted thee, my
son,</q> said his father.
</p>

<p>
<q>'Tis this that has wounded us, old hero, an evil
conflict with warriors,</q> Conall replied.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is thy lord alive?</q> asked Amorgin.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is <hi rend='italic'>not</hi> alive,</q> says Conall.
</p>

<p>
<q>I swear to God what the great tribes of Ulster
swear: he is a coward who goes out of a fight alive
having left his lord with his foes in death.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My wounds are not white, old hero,</q> says Conall.
He showed him his shield-arm, whereon were thrice fifty
spear-wounds. The sword-arm, which the shield had not
guarded, was mangled and maimed and wounded and
pierced, save that the sinews kept it to the body without
separation.
</p>

<p>
<q>That arm fought to-night, my son,</q> says Amorgin.
</p>

<p>
<q>True is that, old hero,</q> says Conall of the
Victories. <q>Many are they to whom it gave drinks of
death to-night in front of the Hostel.</q>
</p>

CHAPTER V: TALES OF THE
ULTONIAN CYCLE
</head>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Curse of Macha</hi>
</p>

<p>
The centre of interest in Irish legend now shifts
from Tara to Ulster, and a multitude of heroic
tales gather round the Ulster king Conor
mac Nessa, round Cuchulain,<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Koohoo´lin.</q>
</p></note> his great vassal, and the
Red Branch Order of chivalry, which had its seat in
Emain Macha.
</p>

<p>
The legend of the foundation of Emain Macha has
already been told.<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page150'>p. 150</ref>.
</p></note> But Macha, who was no mere
woman, but a supernatural being, appears again in connexion
with the history of Ulster in a very curious tale
which was supposed to account for the strange debility
or helplessness that at critical moments sometimes fell,
it was believed, upon the warriors of the province.
</p>

<p>
The legend tells that a wealthy Ulster farmer named
Crundchu, son of Agnoman, dwelling in a solitary place
among the hills, found one day in his dūn a young
woman of great beauty and in splendid array, whom he
had never seen before. Crundchu, we are told, was a
widower, his wife having died after bearing him four
sons. The strange woman, without a word, set herself
to do the houshold tasks, prepared dinner, milked the
cow, and took on herself all the duties of the mistress
of the household. At night she lay down at Crundchu's
side, and thereafter dwelt with him as his wife;
and they loved each other dearly. Her name was
Macha.
</p>

<p>
One day Crundchu prepared himself to go to a great
fair or assembly of the Ultonians, where there would
be feasting and horse-racing, tournaments and music, and
merrymaking of all kinds. Macha begged her husband
<pb n='179' id='page179'/>
not to go. He persisted. <q>Then,</q> she said, <q>at least
do not speak of me in the assembly, for I may dwell
with you only so long as I am not spoken of.</q>
</p>

<p>
It has been observed that we have here the earliest
appearance in post-classical European literature of the
well-known motive of the fairy bride who can stay with
her mortal lover only so long as certain conditions are
observed, such as that he shall not spy upon her, ill-treat
her, or ask of her origin.
</p>

<p>
Crundchu promised to obey the injunction, and went
to the festival. Here the two horses of the king
carried off prize after prize in the racing, and the people
cried: <q>There is not in Ireland a swifter than the
King's pair of horses.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have a wife at home,</q> said Crundchu, in a
moment of forgetfulness, <q>who can run quicker than
these horses.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Seize that man,</q> said the angry king, <q>and hold
him till his wife be brought to the contest.</q>
</p>

<p>
So messengers went for Macha, and she was brought
before the assembly; and she was with child. The
king bade her prepare for the race. She pleaded her
condition. <q>I am close upon my hour,</q> she said.
<q>Then hew her man in pieces,</q> said the king to his
guards. Macha turned to the bystanders. <q>Help
me,</q> she cried, <q>for a mother hath borne each of you!
Give me but a short delay till I am delivered.</q> But
the king and all the crowd in their savage lust for
sport would hear of no delay. <q>Then bring up the
horses,</q> said Macha, <q>and because you have no pity a
heavier infamy shall fall upon you.</q> So she raced
against the horses, and outran them, but as she came
to the goal she gave a great cry, and her travail
seized her, and she gave birth to twin children. As
she uttered that cry, however, all the spectators felt
<pb n='180' id='page180'/>
themselves seized with pangs like her own and had no
more strength than a woman in her travail. And Macha
prophesied: <q>From this hour the shame you have
wrought on me will fall upon each man of Ulster. In
the hours of your greatest need ye shall be weak and
helpless as women in childbirth, and this shall endure
for five days and four nights&mdash;to the ninth generation
the curse shall be upon you.</q> And so it came to pass;
and this is the cause of the Debility of the Ultonians
that was wont to afflict the warriors of the province.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Conor mac Nessa</hi>
</p>

<p>
The chief occasion on which this Debility was manifested
was when Maev, Queen of Connacht, made the
famous Cattle-raid of Quelgny (<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Tain Bo Cuailgné</foreign>),
which forms the subject of the greatest tale in Irish
literature. We have now to relate the preliminary
history leading up to this epic tale and introducing its
chief characters.
</p>

<p>
Fachtna the Giant, King of Ulster, had to wife
Nessa, daughter of Echid Yellow-heel, and she bore him
a son named Conor. But when Fachtna died Fergus
son of Roy, his half-brother, succeeded him, Conor
being then but a youth. Now Fergus loved Nessa,
and would have wedded her, but she made conditions.
<q>Let my son Conor reign one year,</q> she said, <q>so that
his posterity may be the descendants of a king, and I
consent.</q> Fergus agreed, and young Conor took the
throne. But so wise and prosperous was his rule and
so sagacious his judgments that, at the year's end, the
people,as Nessa foresaw, would have him remain king;
and Fergus, who loved the feast and the chase better
than the toils of kingship, was content to have it so,
and remained at Conor's court for a time, great,
honoured, and happy, but king no longer.
</p>


<pb n='181' id='page181'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Red Branch</hi>
</p>

<p>
In his time was the glory of the <q>Red Branch</q> in
Ulster, who were the offspring of Ross the Red, King
of Ulster, with collateral relatives and allies, forming
ultimately a kind of warlike Order. Most of the Red
Branch heroes appear in the Ultonian Cycle of legend,
so that a statement of their names and relationships may
be usefully placed here before we proceed to speak of their
doings. It is noticeable that they have a partly supernatural
ancestry. Ross the Red, it is said, wedded
a Danaan woman, Maga, daughter of Angus Ōg.<note place='foot'><p>
See pp. 121-123 for an account of this deity.
</p></note> As
a second wife he wedded a maiden named Roy. His
descendants are as follows:

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Birth of Cuchulain</hi>
</p>

<p>
It was during the reign of Conor mac Nessa that the
birth of the mightiest hero of the Celtic race, Cuchulain,
came about, and this was the manner of it. The maiden
Dectera, daughter of Cathbad, with fifty young girls,
her companions at the court of Conor, one day disappeared,
and for three years no searching availed to
discover their dwelling-place or their fate. At last one
summer day a flock of birds descended on the fields
about Emain Macha and began to destroy the crops
and fruit. The king, with Fergus and others of his
nobles, went out against them with slings, but the birds
flew only a little way off, luring the party on and on till
at last they found themselves near the Fairy Mound of
Angus on the river Boyne. Night fell, and the king
sent Fergus with a party to discover some habitation
where they might sleep. A hut was found, where they
betook themselves to rest, but one of them, exploring
further, came to a noble mansion by the river, and on
entering it was met by a young man of splendid appearance.
With the stranger was a lovely woman, his wife,
and fifty maidens, who saluted the Ulster warrior with
joy. And he recognised in them Dectera and her
maidens, whom they had missed for three years, and in
the glorious youth Lugh of the Long Arm, son of
Ethlinn. He went back with his tale to the king, who
immediately sent for Dectera to come to him. She,
alleging that she was ill, requested a delay; and so the
night passed; but in the morning there was found in
the hut among the Ulster warriors a new-born male
infant. It was Dectera's gift to Ulster, and for this
purpose she had lured them to the fairy palace by the
Boyne. The child was taken home by the warriors and
was given to Dectera's sister, Finchoom, who was then
<pb n='183' id='page183'/>
nursing her own child, Conall, and the boy's name was
called Setanta. And the part of Ulster from Dundalk
southward to Usna in Meath, which is called the Plain
of Murthemney, was allotted for his inheritance, and in
later days his fortress and dwelling-place was in Dundalk.
</p>

<p>
It is said that the Druid Morann prophesied over the
infant: <q>His praise will be in the mouths of all men;
charioteers and warriors, kings and sages will recount
his deeds; he will win the love of many. This child
will avenge all your wrongs; he will give combat at
your fords, he will decide all your quarrels.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Hound of Cullan</hi>
</p>

<p>
When he was old enough the boy Setanta went to
the court of Conor to be brought up and instructed
along with the other sons of princes and chieftains. It
was now that the event occurred from which he got the
name of Cuchulain, by which he was hereafter to be
known.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon King Conor and his nobles were going
to a feast to which they were bidden at the dūn of
a wealthy smith named Cullan, in Quelgny, where
they also meant to spend the night. Setanta was to
accompany them, but as the cavalcade set off he was in
the midst of a game of hurley with his companions and
bade the king go forward, saying he would follow later
when his play was done. The royal company arrived
at their destination as night began to fall. Cullan
received them hospitably, and in the great hall they
made merry over meat and wine while the lord of the
house barred the gates of his fortress and let loose
outside a huge and ferocious dog which every night
guarded the lonely mansion, and under whose protection,
it was said, Cullan feared nothing less than the onset of
an army.
</p>


<pb n='184' id='page184'/>

<p>
But they had forgotten Setanta! In the middle of
the laughter and music of the feast a terrible sound
was heard which brought every man to his feet in an
instant. It was the tremendous baying of the hound
of Cullan, giving tongue as it saw a stranger approach.
Soon the noise changed to the howls of a fierce combat,
but, on rushing to the gates, they saw in the glare of
the lanterns a young boy and the hound lying dead
at his feet. When it flew at him he had seized it by
the throat and dashed its life out against the side-posts
of the gate. The warriors bore in the lad with rejoicing
and wonder, but soon the triumph ceased, for there
stood their host, silent and sorrowful over the body of
his faithful friend, who had died for the safety of his
house and would never guard it more.
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me,</q> then said the lad Setanta, <q>a whelp of
that hound, O Cullan, and I will train him to be all to
you that his sire was. And until then give me shield
and spear and I will myself guard your house; never
hound guarded it better than I will.</q>
</p>

<p>
And all the company shouted applause at the generous
pledge, and on the spot, as a commemoration of his
first deed of valour, they named the lad Cuchulain,<note place='foot'><p>
It is noticeable that among the characters figuring in the
Ultonian legendary cycle many names occur of which the word
<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Cu</foreign> (hound) forms a part. Thus we have Curoi, Cucorb, Beälcu,
&amp;c. The reference is no doubt to the Irish wolf-hound, a fine type
of valour and beauty.
</p></note>
the Hound of Cullan, and by that name he was known
until he died.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Cuchulain Assumes Arms</hi>
</p>

<p>
When he was older, and near the time when he
might assume the weapons of manhood, it chanced one
day that he passed close by where Cathbad the Druid
<pb n='185' id='page185'/>
was teaching to certain of his pupils the art of divination
and augury. One of them asked of Cathbad
for what kind of enterprise that same day might be
favourable; and Cathbad, having worked a spell of
divination, said: <q>The youth who should take up
arms on this day would become of all men in Erin
most famous for great deeds, yet will his life be short
and fleeting.</q> Cuchulain passed on as though he
marked it not, and he came before the king. <q>What
wilt thou?</q> asked Conor. <q>To take the arms of
manhood,</q> said Cuchulain. <q>So be it,</q> said the king,
and he gave the lad two great spears. But Cuchulain
shook them in his hand, and the staves splintered and
broke. And so he did with many others; and the
chariots in which they set him to drive he broke to
pieces with stamping of his foot, until at last the king's
own chariot of war and his two spears and sword were
brought to the lad, and these he could not break, do
what he would; so this equipment he retained.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>His Courtship of Emer</hi>
</p>

<p>
The young Cuchulain was by this grown so fair and
noble a youth that every maid or matron on whom he
looked was bewitched by him, and the men of Ulster
bade him take a wife of his own. But none were
pleasing to him, till at last he saw the lovely maiden
Emer, daughter of Forgall, the lord of Lusca,<note place='foot'><p>
Now Lusk, a village on the coast a few miles north of Dublin.
</p></note> and he
resolved to woo her for his bride. So he bade harness
his chariot, and with Laeg, his friend and charioteer,
he journeyed to Dūn Forgall.
</p>

<p>
As he drew near, the maiden was with her companions,
daughters of the vassals of Forgall, and she
was teaching them embroidery, for in that art she
excelled all women. She had <q>the six gifts of
<pb n='186' id='page186'/>
womanhood&mdash;the gift of beauty, the gift of voice,
the gift of sweet speech, the gift of needlework, the
gift of wisdom, and the gift of chastity.</q>
</p>

<p>
Hearing the thunder of horse-hoofs and the clangour
of the chariot from afar, she bade one of the maidens
go to the rampart of the Dūn and tell her what she
saw. <q>A chariot is coming on,</q> said the maiden,
<q>drawn by two steeds with tossing heads, fierce and
powerful; one is grey, the other black. They breathe
fire from their jaws, and the clods of turf they throw
up behind them as they race are like a flock of birds
that follow in their track. In the chariot is a dark, sad
man, comeliest of the men of Erin. He is clad in a
crimson cloak, with a brooch of gold, and on his back
is a crimson shield with a silver rim wrought with
figures of beasts. With him as his charioteer is a tall,
slender, freckled man with curling red hair held by a
fillet of bronze, with plates of gold at either side of his
face. With a goad of red gold he urges the horses.</q>
</p>

<p>
When the chariot drew up Emer went to meet
Cuchulain and saluted him. But when he urged his
love upon her she told him of the might and the
wiliness of her father Forgall, and of the strength of
the champions that guarded her lest she should wed
against his will. And when he pressed her more she
said: <q>I may not marry before my sister Fial, who is
older than I. She is with me here&mdash;she is excellent
in handiwork.</q> <q>It is not Fial whom I love,</q> said
Cuchulain. Then as they were conversing he saw the
breast of the maiden over the bosom of her smock,
and said to her: <q>Fair is this plain, the plain of the
noble yoke.</q> <q>None comes to this plain,</q> said she, <q>who
has not slain his hundreds, and thy deeds are still to do.</q>
</p>

<p>
So Cuchulain then left her, and drove back to Emain
Macha.
</p>


<pb n='187' id='page187'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Cuchulain in the Land of Skatha</hi>
</p>

<p>
Next day Cuchulain bethought himself how he could
prepare himself for war and for the deeds of heroism
which Emer had demanded of him. Now he had
heard of a mighty woman-warrior named Skatha, who
dwelt in the Land of Shadows,<note place='foot'><p>
Owing to the similarity of the name the supernatural country
of Skatha, <q>the Shadowy,</q> was early identified with the islands of
Skye, where the Cuchulain Peaks still bear witness to the legend.
</p></note> and who could teach
to young heroes who came to her wonderful feats of
arms. So Cuchulain went overseas to find her, and
many dangers he had to meet, black forests and desert
plains to traverse, before he could get tidings of Skatha
and her land. At last he came to the Plain of Ill-luck,
where he could not cross without being mired in its
bottomless bogs or sticky clay, and while he was
debating what he should do he saw coming towards
him a young man with a face that shone like the sun,<note place='foot'><p>
This, of course, was Cuchulain's father, Lugh.
</p></note>
and whose very look put cheerfulness and hope into
his heart. The young man gave him a wheel and told
him to roll it before him on the plain, and to follow
it whithersoever it went. So Cuchulain set the wheel
rolling, and as it went it blazed with light that shot like
rays from its rim, and the heat of it made a firm path
across the quagmire, where Cuchulain followed safely.
</p>

<p>
When he had passed the Plain of Ill-luck, and
escaped the beasts of the Perilous Glen, he came to the
Bridge of the Leaps, beyond which was the country of
Skatha. Here he found on the hither side many sons
of the princes of Ireland who were come to learn feats
of war from Skatha, and they were playing at hurley
on the green. And among them was his friend Ferdia,
son of the Firbolg, Daman; and they all asked him of
<pb n='188' id='page188'/>
the news from Ireland. When he had told them all
he asked Ferdia how he should pass to the dūn of
Skatha. Now the Bridge of Leaps was very narrow
and very high, and it crossed a gorge where far
below swung the tides of a boiling sea, in which
ravenous monsters could be seen swimming.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not one of us has crossed that bridge,</q> said
Ferdia, <q>for there are two feats that Skatha teaches
last, and one is the leap across the bridge, and the
other the thrust of the Gae Bolg.<note place='foot'><p>
This means probably <q>the belly spear.</q> With this terrible
weapon Cuchulain was fated in the end to slay his friend Ferdia.
</p></note> For if a man step
upon one end of that bridge, the middle straightway
rises up and flings him back, and if he leap upon it he
may chance to miss his footing and fall into the gulf,
where the sea-monsters are waiting for him.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Cuchulain waited till evening, when he had
recovered his strength from his long journey, and then
essayed the crossing of the bridge. Three times he
ran towards it from a distance, gathering all his powers
together, and strove to leap upon the middle, but three
times it rose against him and flung him back, while his
companions jeered at him because he would not wait
for the help of Skatha. But at the fourth leap he lit
fairly on the centre of the bridge, and with one leap
more he was across it, and stood before the strong
fortress of Skatha; and she wondered at his courage
and vigour, and admitted him to be her pupil.
</p>

<p>
For a year and a day Cuchulain abode with Skatha,
and all the feats she had to teach he learned easily, and
last of all she taught him the use of the Gae Bolg, and
gave him that dreadful weapon, which she had deemed
no champion before him good enough to have. And
the manner of using the Gae Bolg was that it was
thrown with the foot, and if it entered an enemy's
<pb n='189' id='page189'/>
body it filled every limb and crevice of him with its
barbs. While Cuchulain dwelt with Skatha his friend
above all friends and his rival in skill and valour was
Ferdia, and ere they parted they vowed to love and
help one another as long as they should live.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Cuchulain and Aifa</hi>
</p>

<p>
Now whilst Cuchulain was in the Land of the Shadows
it chanced that Skatha made war on the people of the
Princess Aifa, who was the fiercest and strongest of the
woman-warriors of the world, so that even Skatha
feared to meet her in arms. On going forth to the
war, therefore, Skatha mixed with Cuchulain's drink a
sleepy herb so that he should not wake for four-and-twenty
hours, by which time the host would be far on
its way, for she feared lest evil should come to him ere
he had got his full strength. But the potion that
would have served another man for a day and a night
only held Cuchulain for one hour; and when he waked
up he seized his arms and followed the host by its
chariot-tracks till he came up with them. Then it is
said that Skatha uttered a sigh, for she knew that he
would not be restrained from the war.
</p>

<p>
When the armies met, Cuchulain and the two sons
of Skatha wrought great deeds on the foe, and slew six
of the mightiest of Aifa's warriors. Then Aifa sent
word to Skatha and challenged her to single combat.
But Cuchulain declared that he would meet the fair
Fury in place of Skatha, and he asked first of all what
were the things she most valued. <q>What Aifa loves
most,</q> said Skatha, <q>are her two horses, her chariot
and her charioteer.</q> Then the pair met in single
combat, and every champion's feat which they knew
they tried on each other in vain, till at last a blow of
Aifa's shattered the sword of Cuchulain to the hilt.
<pb n='190' id='page190'/>
At this Cuchulain cried out: <q>Ah me! behold the
chariot and horses of Aifa, fallen into the glen!</q> Aifa
glanced round, and Cuchulain, rushing in, seized her
round the waist and slung her over his shoulder and
bore her back to the camp of Skatha. There he flung
her on the ground and put his knife to her throat.
She begged for her life, and Cuchulain granted it on
condition that she made a lasting peace with Skatha,
and gave hostages for her fulfilment of the pledge.
To this she agreed, and Cuchulain and she became not
only friends but lovers.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tragedy of Cuchulain and Connla</hi>
</p>

<p>
Before Cuchulain left the Land of Shadows he gave
Aifa a golden ring, saying that if she should bear him
a son he was to be sent to seek his father in Erin so
soon as he should have grown so that his finger would
fit the ring. And Cuchulain said, <q>Charge him under
<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> that he shall not make himself known, that he
never turn out of the way for any man, nor ever
refuse a combat. And be his name called Connla.</q>
</p>

<p>
In later years it is narrated that one day when King
Conor of Ulster and the lords of Ulster were at a
festal gathering on the Strand of the Footprints they
saw coming towards them across the sea a little boat of
bronze, and in it a young lad with gilded oars in his
hands. In the boat was a heap of stones, and ever and
anon the lad would put one of these stones into a sling
and cast it at a flying sea-bird in such fashion that it
would bring down the bird alive to his feet. And
many other wonderful feats of skill he did. Then
Conor said, as the boat drew nearer: <q>If the grown
men of that lad's country came here they would surely
grind us to powder. Woe to the land into which that
boy shall come!</q>
</p>


<pb n='191' id='page191'/>

<p>
When the boy came to land, a messenger, Condery,
was sent to bid him be off. <q>I will not turn back for
thee,</q> said the lad, and Condery repeated what he had
said to the king. Then Conall of the Victories was
sent against him, but the lad slung a great stone at him,
and the whizz and wind of it knocked him down, and
the lad sprang upon him, and bound his arms with the
strap of his shield. And so man after man was served;
some were bound, and some were slain, but the lad
defied the whole power of Ulster to turn him back, nor
would he tell his name or lineage.
</p>

<p>
<q>Send for Cuchulain,</q> then said King Conor. And
they sent a messenger to Dundalk, where Cuchulain
was with Emer his wife, and bade him come to do
battle against a stranger boy whom Conall of the
Victories could not overcome. Emer threw her arm
round Cuchulain's neck. <q>Do not go,</q> she entreated.
<q>Surely this is the son of Aifa. Slay not thine only
son.</q> But Cuchulain said: <q>Forbear, woman! Were
it Connla himself I would slay him for the honour of
Ulster,</q> and he bade yoke his chariot and went to the
Strand. Here he found the boy tossing up his weapons
and doing marvellous feats with them. <q>Delightful
is thy play, boy,</q> said Cuchulain; <q>who art thou and
whence dost thou come?</q> <q>I may not reveal that,</q>
said the lad. <q>Then thou shalt die,</q> said Cuchulain.
<q>So be it,</q> said the lad, and then they fought with
swords for a while, till the lad delicately shore off a
lock of Cuchulain's hair. <q>Enough of trifling,</q> said
Cuchulain, and they closed with each other, but the
lad planted himself on a rock and stood so firm that
Cuchulain could not move him, and in the stubborn
wrestling they had the lad's two feet sank deep into
the stone and made the footprints whence the Strand
of the Footprints has its name. At last they both fell
<pb n='192' id='page192'/>
into the sea, and Cuchulain was near being drowned, till
he bethought himself of the Gae Bolg, and he drove
that weapon against the lad and it ripped up his belly.
<q>That is what Skatha never taught me,</q> cried the lad.
<q>Woe is me, for I am hurt.</q> Cuchulain looked at him
and saw the ring on his finger. <q>It is true,</q> he said;
and he took up the boy and bore him on shore and
laid him down before Conor and the lords of Ulster.
<q>Here is my son for you, men of Ulster,</q> he said.
And the boy said: <q>It is true. And if I had five years
to grow among you, you would conquer the world on
every side of you and rule as far as Rome. But since
it is as it is, point out to me the famous warriors that
are here, that I may know them and take leave of them
before I die.</q> Then one after another they were brought
to him, and he kissed them and took leave of his father,
and he died; and the men of Ulster made his grave and
set up his pillar-stone with great mourning. This was
the only son Cuchulain ever had, and this son he slew.
</p>

<p>
This tale, as I have given it here, dates from the ninth
century, and is found in the <q>Yellow Book of Lecan.</q>
There are many other Gaelic versions of it in poetry
and prose. It is one of the earliest extant appearances
in literature of the since well-known theme of the
slaying of a heroic son by his father. The Persian
rendering of it in the tale of Sohrab and Rustum has
been made familiar by Matthew Arnold's fine poem.
In the Irish version it will be noted that the father is
not without a suspicion of the identity of his antagonist,
but he does battle with him under the stimulus of that
passionate sense of loyalty to his prince and province
which was Cuchulain's most signal characteristic.
</p>

<p>
To complete the story of Aifa and her son we have
anticipated events, and now turn back to take up the
thread again.
</p>


<pb n='193' id='page193'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Cuchulain's First Foray</hi>
</p>

<p>
After a year and a day of training in warfare under
Skatha, Cuchulain returned to Erin, eager to test his
prowess and to win Emer for his wife. So he bade
harness his chariot and drove out to make a foray upon
the fords and marches of Connacht, for between Connacht
and Ulster there was always an angry surf of
fighting along the borders.
</p>

<p>
And first he drove to the White Cairn, which is on
the highest of the Mountains of Mourne, and surveyed
the land of Ulster spread out smiling in the sunshine
far below and bade his charioteer tell him the name
of every hill and plain and dūn that he saw. Then
turning southwards he looked over the plains of Bregia,
and the charioteer pointed out to him Tara and Teltin,
and Brugh na Boyna and the great dūn of the sons of
Nechtan. <q>Are they,</q> asked Cuchulain, <q>those sons
of Nechtan of whom it is said that more of the men of
Ulster have fallen by their hands than are yet living
on the earth?</q> <q>The same,</q> said the charioteer.
<q>Then let us drive thither,</q> said Cuchulain. So,
much unwilling, the charioteer drove to the fortress of
the sons of Nechtan, and there on the green before it
they found a pillar-stone, and round it a collar of
bronze having on it writing in Ogham. This Cuchulain
read, and it declared that any man of age to bear arms
who should come to that green should hold it <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign> for
him to depart without having challenged one of the
dwellers in the dūn to single combat. Then Cuchulain
flung his arms round the stone, and, swaying it backwards
and forwards, heaved it at last out of the earth
and flung it, collar and all, into the river that ran hard
by. <q>Surely,</q> said the charioteer, <q>thou art seeking for
a violent death, and now thou wilt find it without delay.</q>
</p>


<pb n='194' id='page194'/>

<p>
Then Foill son of Nechtan came forth from the
dūn, and seeing Cuchulain, whom he deemed but a lad,
he was annoyed. But Cuchulain bade him fetch his
arms, <q>for I slay not drivers nor messengers nor
unarmed men,</q> and Foill went back into the dūn.
<q>Thou canst not slay him,</q> then said the charioteer,
<q>for he is invulnerable by magic power to the point or
edge of any blade.</q> But Cuchulain put in his sling a
ball of tempered iron, and when Foill appeared he
slung at him so that it struck his forehead, and went
clean through brain and skull; and Cuchulain took his
head and bound it to his chariot-rim. And other sons
of Nechtan, issuing forth, he fought with and slew by
sword or spear; and then he fired the dūn and left it
in a blaze and drove on exultant. And on the way he
saw a flock of wild swans, and sixteen of them he
brought down alive with his sling, and tied them to
the chariot; and seeing a herd of wild deer which his
horses could not overtake he lighted down and chased
them on foot till he caught two great stags, and with
thongs and ropes he made them fast to the chariot.
</p>

<p>
But at Emain Macha a scout of King Conor came
running in to give him news. <q>Behold, a solitary
chariot is approaching swiftly over the plain; wild
white birds flutter round it and wild stags are tethered
to it; it is decked all round with the bleeding heads of
enemies.</q> And Conor looked to see who was approaching,
and he saw that Cuchulain was in his battle-fury,
and would deal death around him whomsoever he met;
so he hastily gave order that a troop of the women of
Emania should go forth to meet him, and, having
stripped off their clothing, should stand naked in the
way. This they did, and when the lad saw them,
smitten with shame, he bowed his head upon the
chariot-rim. Then Conor's men instantly seized him
<pb n='195' id='page195'/>
and plunged him into a vat of cold water which had
been made ready, but the water boiled around him and
the staves and hoops of the vat were burst asunder.
This they did again and yet again, and at last his fury
left him, and his natural form and aspect were restored.
Then they clad him in fresh raiment and bade him in
to the feast in the king's banqueting-hall.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Winning of Emer</hi>
</p>

<p>
Next day he went to the dūn of Forgall the Wily,
father of Emer, and he leaped <q>the hero's salmon leap,</q>
that he had learned of Skatha, over the high ramparts
of the dūn. Then the mighty men of Forgall set on
him, and he dealt but three blows, and each blow slew
eight men, and Forgall himself fell lifeless in leaping
from the rampart of the dūn to escape Cuchulain.
So he carried off Emer and her foster-sister and two
loads of gold and silver. But outside the dūn the
sister of Forgall raised a host against him, and his
battle-fury came on him, and furious were the blows he
dealt, so that the ford of Glondath ran blood and the
turf on Crofot was trampled into bloody mire. A
hundred he slew at every ford from Olbiny to the
Boyne; and so was Emer won as she desired, and he
brought her to Emain Macha and made her his wife,
and they were not parted again until he died.

<hi rend='bold'>Cuchulain Champion of Erin</hi>
</p>

<p>
A lord of Ulster named Briccriu of the Poisoned
Tongue once made a feast to which he bade King
Conor and all the heroes of the Red Branch, and
because it was always his delight to stir up strife among
men or women he set the heroes contending among
themselves as to who was the champion of the land of
Erin. At last it was agreed that the championship
<pb n='196' id='page196'/>
must lie among three of them, namely, Cuchulain,
and Conall of the Victories and Laery the Triumphant.
To decide between these three a demon named The
Terrible was summoned from a lake in the depth of
which he dwelt. He proposed to the heroes a test of
courage. Any one of them, he said, might cut off his
head to-day provided that he, the claimant of the
championship, would lay down his own head for the
axe to-morrow. Conall and Laery shrank from the
test, but Cuchulain accepted it, and after reciting a
charm over his sword, he cut off the head of the demon,
who immediately rose, and taking the bleeding head in
one hand and his axe in the other, plunged into the lake.
</p>

<p>
Next day he reappeared, whole and sound, to claim
the fulfilment of the bargain. Cuchulain, quailing but
resolute, laid his head on the block. <q>Stretch out
your neck, wretch,</q> cried the demon; <q>'tis too short
for me to strike at.</q> Cuchulain does as he is bidden.
The demon swings his axe thrice over his victim,
brings down the butt with a crash on the block, and
then bids Cuchulain rise unhurt, Champion of Ireland
and her boldest man.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Deirdre and the Sons of Usna</hi>
</p>

<p>
We have now to turn to a story in which Cuchulain
takes no part. It is the chief of the preliminary tales
to the Cattle-spoil of Quelgny.
</p>

<p>
There was among the lords of Ulster, it is said,
one named Felim son of Dall, who on a certain day
made a great feast for the king. And the king came
with his Druid Cathbad, and Fergus mac Roy, and
many heroes of the Red Branch, and while they were
making merry over the roasted flesh and wheaten cakes
and Greek wine a messenger from the women's apartments
<pb n='197' id='page197'/>
came to tell Felim that his wife had just borne
him a daughter. So all the lords and warriors drank
health to the new-born infant, and the king bade Cathbade
perform divination in the manner of the Druids
and foretell what the future would have in store for
Felim's babe. Cathbad gazed upon the stars and drew
the horoscope of the child, and he was much troubled;
and at length he said: <q>The infant shall be fairest
among the women of Erin, and shall wed a king, but
because of her shall death and ruin come upon the
Province of Ulster.</q> Then the warriors would have
put her to death upon the spot, but Conor forbade
them. <q>I will avert the doom,</q> he said, <q>for she
shall wed no foreign king, but she shall be my own
mate when she is of age.</q> So he took away the child,
and committed it to his nurse Levarcam, and the name
they gave it was Deirdre. And Conor charged Levarcam
that the child should be brought up in a strong
dūn in the solitude of a great wood, and that no young
man should see her or she him until she was of
marriageable age for the king to wed. And there she
dwelt, seeing none but her nurse and Cathbad, and
sometimes the king, now growing an aged man, who
would visit the dūn from time to time to see that all
was well with the folk there, and that his commands
were observed.
</p>

<p>
One day, when the time for the marriage of Deirdre
and Conor was drawing near, Deirdre and Levarcam
looked over the rampart of their dūn. It was winter,
a heavy snow had fallen in the night, and in the still,
frosty air the trees stood up as if wrought in silver,
and the green before the dūn was a sheet of unbroken
white, save that in one place a scullion had killed a calf
for their dinner, and the blood of the calf lay on the
snow. And as Deirdre looked, a raven lit down from
<pb n='198' id='page198'/>
a tree hard by and began to sip the blood. <q>O nurse,</q>
cried Deirdre suddenly, <q>such, and not like Conor,
would be the man that I would love&mdash;his hair like the
raven's wing, and in his cheek the hue of blood, and
his skin as white as snow.</q> <q>Thou hast pictured a
man of Conor's household,</q> said the nurse. <q>Who is
he?</q> asked Deirdre. <q>He is Naisi, son of Usna,<note place='foot'><p>
See genealogical table, p. 181.
</p></note> a
champion of the Red Branch,</q> said the nurse. Thereupon
Deirdre entreated Levarcam to bring her to speak
with Naisi; and because the old woman loved the girl
and would not have her wedded to the aged king, she
at last agreed. Deirdre implored Naisi to save her
from Conor, but he would not, till at last her entreaties
and her beauty won him, and he vowed to be hers.
Then secretly one night he came with his two brethren,
Ardan and Ainlé, and bore away Deirdre with Levarcam,
and they escaped the king's pursuit and took ship for
Scotland, where Naisi took service with the King of
the Picts. Yet here they could not rest, for the king
got sight of Deirdre, and would have taken her from
Naisi, but Naisi with his brothers escaped, and in the
solitude of Glen Etive they made their dwelling by the
lake, and there lived in the wild wood by hunting
and fishing, seeing no man but themselves and their
servants.
</p>

<p>
And the years went by and Conor made no sign,
but he did not forget, and his spies told him of all that
befell Naisi and Deirdre. At last, judging that Naisi
and his brothers would have tired of solitude, he sent
the bosom friend of Naisi, Fergus son of Roy, to bid
them return, and to promise them that all would be
forgiven. Fergus went joyfully, and joyfully did Naisi
and his brothers hear the message, but Deirdre foresaw
evil, and would fain have sent Fergus home alone.
<pb n='199' id='page199'/>
But Naisi blamed her for her doubt and suspicion, and
bade her mark that they were under the protection of
Fergus, whose safeguard no king in Ireland would
dare to violate; and they at last made ready to go.
</p>

<p>
On landing in Ireland they were met by Baruch, a
lord of the Red Branch, who had his dūn close by,
and he bade Fergus to a feast he had prepared for him
that night. <q>I may not stay,</q> said Fergus, <q>for I
must first convey Deirdre and the sons of Usna safely
to Emain Macha.</q> <q>Nevertheless,</q> said Baruch,
<q>thou must stay with me to-night, for it is a <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign> for
thee to refuse a feast.</q> Deirdre implored him not
to leave them, but Fergus was tempted by the feast,
and feared to break his <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign>, and he bade his two sons
Illan the Fair and Buino the Red take charge of the
party in his place, and he himself abode with Baruch.
</p>

<p>
And so the party came to Emain Macha, and they
were lodged in the House of the Red Branch, but
Conor did not receive them. After the evening meal,
as he sat, drinking heavily and silently, he sent a
messenger to bid Levarcam come before him. <q>How
is it with the sons of Usna?</q> he said to her. <q>It is
well,</q> she said. <q>Thou hast got the three most valorous
champions in Ulster in thy court. Truly the king who
has those three need fear no enemy.</q> <q>Is it well with
Deirdre?</q> he asked. <q>She is well,</q> said the nurse,
<q>but she has lived many years in the wildwood, and
toil and care have changed her&mdash;little of her beauty of
old now remains to her, O King.</q> Then the king
dismissed her, and sat drinking again. But after a
while he called to him a servant named Trendorn, and
bade him go to the Red Branch House and mark who
was there and what they did. But when Trendorn
came the place was bolted and barred for the night,
and he could not get an entrance, and at last he
<pb n='200' id='page200'/>
mounted on a ladder and looked in at a high window.
And there he saw the brothers of Naisi and the sons of
Fergus, as they talked or cleaned their arms, or made
them ready for slumber, and there sat Naisi with a
chess-board before him, and playing chess with him
was the fairest of women that he had ever seen. But
as he looked in wonder at the noble pair, suddenly one
caught sight of him and rose with a cry, pointing to
the face at the window. And Naisi looked up and
saw it, and seizing a chessman from the board he
hurled it at the face of the spy, and it struck out his
eye. Then Trendorn hastily descended, and went back
with his bloody face to the king. <q>I have seen them,</q>
he cried, <q>I have seen the fairest woman of the world,
and but that Naisi had struck my eye out I had been
looking on her still.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Conor arose and called for his guards and bade
them bring the sons of Usna before him for maiming
his messenger. And the guards went; but first Buino,
son of Fergus, with his retinue, met them, and at the
sword's point drove them back; but Naisi and Deirdre
continued quietly to play chess, <q>For,</q> said Naisi, <q>it
is not seemly that we should seek to defend ourselves
while we are under the protection of the sons of Fergus.</q>
But Conor went to Buino, and with a great gift of lands
he bought him over to desert his charge. Then Illan
took up the defence of the Red Branch Hostel, but the
two sons of Conor slew him. And then at last Naisi
and his brothers seized their weapons and rushed amid
the foe, and many were they who fell before the onset.
Then Conor entreated Cathbad the Druid to cast spells
upon them lest they should get away and become the
enemies of the province, and he vowed to do them no
hurt if they were taken alive. So Cathbad conjured
up, as it were, a lake of slime that seemed to be about
<pb n='201' id='page201'/>
the feet of the sons of Usna, and they could not tear
their feet from it, and Naisi caught up Deirdre and put
her on his shoulder, for they seemed to be sinking in
the slime. Then the guards and servants of Conor
seized and bound them and brought them before the
king. And the king called upon man after man to
come forward and slay the sons of Usna, but none
would obey him, till at last Owen son of Duracht and
Prince of Ferney came and took the sword of Naisi,
and with one sweep he shore off the heads of all three,
and so they died.
</p>

<p>
Then Conor took Deirdre perforce, and for a year
she abode with him in the palace in Emain Macha, but
during all that time she never smiled. At length
Conor said: <q>What is it that you hate most of all on
earth, Deirdre?</q> And she said: <q>Thou thyself and
Owen son of Duracht,</q> and Owen was standing by.
<q>Then thou shalt go to Owen for a year,</q> said Conor.
But when Deirdre mounted the chariot behind Owen
she kept her eyes on the ground, for she would not
look on those who thus tormented her; and Conor
said, taunting her: <q>Deirdre, the glance of thee between
me and Owen is the glance of a ewe between two
rams.</q> Then Deirdre started up, and, flinging herself
head foremost from the chariot, she dashed her head
against a rock and fell dead.
</p>

<p>
And when they buried her it is said there grew from
her grave and from Naisi's two yew-trees, whose tops,
when they were full-grown, met each other over the
roof of the great church of Armagh, and intertwined
together, and none could part them.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Rebellion of Fergus</hi>
</p>

<p>
When Fergus mac Roy came home to Emain Macha
after the feast to which Baruch bade him and found
<pb n='202' id='page202'/>
the sons of Usna slain and one of his own sons dead
and the other a traitor, he broke out against Conor in
a storm of wrath and cursing, and vowed to be avenged
on him with fire and sword. And he went off
straightway to Connacht to take service of arms with
Ailell and Maev, who were king and queen of that country.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Queen Maev</hi>
</p>

<p>
But though Ailell was king, Maev was the ruler in
truth, and ordered all things as she wished, and took
what husbands she wished, and dismissed them at
pleasure; for she was as fierce and strong as a goddess
of war, and knew no law but her own wild will. She
was tall, it is said, with a long, pale face and masses of
hair yellow as ripe corn. When Fergus came to her
in her palace at Rathcroghan in Roscommon she gave
him her love, as she had given it to many before, and
they plotted together how to attack and devastate the
Province of Ulster.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Brown Bull of Quelgny</hi>
</p>

<p>
Now it happened that Maev possessed a famous red
bull with white front and horns named Finnbenach,
and one day when she and Ailell were counting up
their respective possessions and matching them against
each other he taunted her because the Finnbenach
would not stay in the hands of a woman, but had
attached himself to Ailell's herd. So Maev in vexation
went to her steward, mac Roth, and asked of him if
there were anywhere in Erin a bull as fine as the
Finnbenach. <q>Truly,</q> said the steward, <q>there is&mdash;for
the Brown Bull of Quelgny, that belongs to Dara
son of Fachtna, is the mightiest beast that is in Ireland.</q>
And after that Maev felt as if she had no flocks and
<pb n='203' id='page203'/>
herds that were worth anything at all unless she
possessed the Brown Bull of Quelgny. But this was
in Ulster, and the Ulstermen knew the treasure they
possessed, and Maev knew that they would not give
up the bull without fighting for it. So she and Fergus
and Ailell agreed to make a foray against Ulster for
the Brown Bull, and thus to enter into war with the
province, for Fergus longed for vengeance, and Maev
for fighting, for glory, and for the bull, and Ailell to
satisfy Maev.
</p>

<p>
Here let us note that this contest for the bull, which
is the ostensible theme of the greatest of Celtic legendary
tales, the <q>Tain Bo Cuailgné,</q> has a deeper meaning than
appears on the surface. An ancient piece of Aryan
mythology is embedded in it. The Brown Bull is the
Celtic counterpart of the Hindu sky-deity, Indra, represented
in Hindu myth as a mighty bull, whose roaring
is the thunder and who lets loose the rains <q>like
cows streaming forth to pasture.</q> The advance of the
Western (Connacht) host for the capture of this bull is
emblematic of the onset of Night. The bull is defended
by the solar hero Cuchulain, who, however, is ultimately
overthrown and the bull is captured for a season. The
two animals in the Celtic legend probably typify the sky
in different aspects. They are described with a pomp
and circumstance which shows that they are no common
beasts. Once, we are told, they were swineherds
of the people of Dana. <q>They had been successively
transformed into two ravens, two sea-monsters, two
warriors, two demons, two worms or animalculae, and
finally into two kine.</q><note place='foot'><p>
Miss Hull, <q>The Cuchullin Saga,</q> p. lxxii, where the solar
theory of the Brown Bull is dealt with at length.
</p></note> The Brown Bull is described
as having a back broad enough for fifty children to play
on; when he is angry with his keeper he stamps the
<pb n='204' id='page204'/>
man thirty feet into the ground; he is likened to a
sea wave, to a bear, to a dragon, a lion, the writer
heaping up images of strength and savagery. We are
therefore concerned with no ordinary cattle-raid, but
with a myth, the features of which are discernible under
the dressing given it by the fervid imagination of the
unknown Celtic bard who composed the <q>Tain,</q>
although the exact meaning of every detail may be
difficult to ascertain.
</p>

<p>
The first attempt of Maev to get possession of the
bull was to send an embassy to Dara to ask for the
loan of him for a year, the recompense offered being
fifty heifers, besides the bull himself back, and if Dara
chose to settle in Connacht he should have as much
land there as he now possessed in Ulster, and a chariot
worth thrice seven <hi rend='italic'>cumals</hi>,<note place='foot'><p>
A <hi rend='italic'>cumal</hi> was the unit of value in Celtic Ireland. It is mentioned
as such by St. Patrick. It meant the price of a woman-slave.
</p></note> with the patronage and
friendship of Maev.
</p>

<p>
Dara was at first delighted with the prospect, but
tales were borne to him of the chatter of Maev's
messengers, and how they said that if the bull was not
yielded willingly it would be taken by force; and he
sent back a message of refusal and defiance. <q>'Twas
known,</q> said Maev, <q>the bull will not be yielded by
fair means; he shall now be won by foul.</q> And so
she sent messengers around on every side to summon
her hosts for the Raid.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Hosting of Queen Maev</hi>
</p>

<p>
And there came all the mighty men of Connacht&mdash;first
the seven Mainés, sons of Ailell and Maev, each
with his retinue; and Ket and Anluan, sons of Maga,
with thirty hundreds of armed men; and yellow-haired
Ferdia, with his company of Firbolgs, boisterous giants
<pb n='205' id='page205'/>
who delighted in war and in strong ale. And there
came also the allies of Maev&mdash;a host of the men of
Leinster, who so excelled the rest in warlike skill that
they were broken up and distributed among the
companies of Connacht, lest they should prove a
danger to the host; and Cormac son of Conor, with
Fergus mac Roy and other exiles from Ulster, who
had revolted against Conor for his treachery to the
sons of Usna.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Ulster under the Curse</hi>
</p>

<p>
But before the host set forth towards Ulster Maev
sent her spies into the land to tell her of the preparations
there being made. And the spies brought back
a wondrous tale, and one that rejoiced the heart of
Maev, for they said that the Debility of the Ultonians<note place='foot'><p>
The cune laid on them by Macha. Sec p. 180.
</p></note>
had descended on the province. Conor the king lay
in pangs at Emain Macha, and his son Cuscrid in his
island-fortress, and Owen Prince of Ferney was helpless
as a child; Celtchar, the huge grey warrior, son of
Uthecar Hornskin, and even Conall of the Victories,
lay moaning and writhing on their beds, and there was
no hand in Ulster that could lift a spear.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Prophetic Voices</hi>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless Maev went to her chief Druid, and
demanded of him what her own lot in the war should
be. And the Druid said only: <q>Whoever comes hack
in safety, or comes not, thou thyself shalt come.</q> But
on her journey back she saw suddenly standing before
her chariot-pole a young maiden with tresses of yellow
hair that fell below her knees, and clad in a mantle of
green; and with a shuttle of gold she wove a fabric
upon a loom. <q>Who art thou, girl?</q> said Maev,
<pb n='206' id='page206'/>
<q>and what dost thou?</q> <q>I am the prophetess,
Fedelma, from the Fairy Mound of Croghan,</q> said
the maid, <q>and I weave the four provinces of Ireland
together for the foray into Ulster.</q> <q>How seest thou
our host?</q> asked Maev. <q>I see them all be-crimsoned,
red,</q> replied the prophetess. <q>Yet the Ulster heroes
are all in their pangs&mdash;there is none that can lift a
spear against us,</q> said Maev. <q>I see the host all becrimsoned,</q>
said Fedelma. <q>I see a man of small
stature, but the hero's light is on his brow&mdash;a stripling
young and modest, but in battle a dragon; he is like
unto Cuchulain of Murthemney; he doth wondrous
feats with his weapons; by him your slain shall lie thickly.</q><note place='foot'><p>
Cuchulain, as the son of the god Lugh, was not subject to the
curse of Macha which afflicted the other Ultonians.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
At this the vision of the weaving maiden vanished,
and Maev drove homewards to Rathcroghan wondering
at what she had seen and heard.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Cuchulain Puts the Host under Geise</hi>
</p>

<p>
On the morrow the host set forth, Fergus mac Roy
leading them, and as they neared the confines of
Ulster he bade them keep sharp watch lest Cuchulain
of Murthemney, who guarded the passes of Ulster to
the south, should fall upon them unawares. Now
Cuchulain and his father Sualtam<note place='foot'><p>
His reputed father, the mortal husband of Dectera
</p></note> were on the borders
of the province, and Cuchulain, from a warning Fergus
had sent him, suspected the approach of a great host,
and bade Sualtam go northwards to Emania and warn
the men of Ulster. But Cuchulain himself would not
stay there, for he said he had a tryst to keep with a
handmaid of the wife of Laery the <hi rend='italic'>bodach</hi> (farmer), so
he went into the forest, and there, standing on one leg,
<pb n='207' id='page207'/>
and using only one hand and one eye, he cut an oak
sapling and twisted it into a circular withe. On this
he cut in Ogham characters how the withe was made,
and he put the host of Maev under <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> not to pass
by that place till one of them had, under similar conditions,
made a similar withe; <q>and I except my friend
Fergus mac Roy,</q> he added, and wrote his name at
the end. Then he placed the withe round the pillar-stone
of Ardcullin, and went his way to keep his tryst
with the handmaid.<note place='foot'><p>
In the Irish bardic literature, as in the Homeric epics, chastity
formed no part of the masculine ideal either for gods or men.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
When the host of Maev came to Ardcullin, the withe
upon the pillar-stone was found and brought to Fergus
to decipher it. There was none amongst the host who
could emulate the feat of Cuchulain, and so they went
into the wood and encamped for the night. A heavy
snowfall took place, and they were all in much distress,
but next day the sun rose gloriously, and over the
white plain they marched away into Ulster, counting
the prohibition as extending only for one night.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Ford of the Forked Pole</hi>
</p>

<p>
Cuchulain now followed hard on their track, and as
he went he estimated by the tracks they had left the
number of the host at eighteen <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>triucha cét</foreign> (54,000 men).
Circling round the host, he now met them in front, and
soon came upon two chariots containing scouts sent
ahead by Maev. These he slew, each man with his
driver, and having with one sweep of his sword cut a
forked pole of four prongs from the wood, he drove
the pole deep into a river-ford at the place called
Athgowla,<note place='foot'><p>
<q>The Ford of the Forked Pole.</q>
</p></note> and impaled on each prong a bloody head.
When the host came up they wondered and feared at
<pb n='208' id='page208'/>
the sight, and Fergus declared that they were under
<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> not to pass that ford till one of them had plucked
out the pole even as it was driven in, with the fingertips
of one hand. So Fergus drove into the water to
essay the feat, and seventeen chariots were broken
under him as he tugged at the pole, but at last he tore
it out; and as it was now late the host encamped upon
the spot. These devices of Cuchulain were intended
to delay the invaders until the Ulster men had recovered
from their debility.
</p>

<p>
In the epic, as given in the Book of Leinster, and
other ancient sources, a long interlude now takes place
in which Fergus explains to Maev who it is&mdash;viz., <q>my
little pupil Setanta</q>&mdash;who is thus harrying the host, and
his boyish deeds, some of which have been already told
in this narrative, are recounted.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Charioteer of Orlam</hi>
</p>

<p>
The host proceeded on its way next day, and the
next encounter with Cuchulain shows the hero in a
kindlier mood. He hears a noise of timber being cut,
and going into a wood he finds there a charioteer
belonging to a son of Ailell and Maev cutting down
chariot-poles of holly, <q>For,</q> says he, <q>we have
damaged our chariots sadly in chasing that famous deer,
Cuchulain.</q> Cuchulain&mdash;who, it must be remembered,
was at ordinary times a slight and unimposing figure,
though in battle he dilated in size and underwent a
fearful distortion, symbolic of Berserker fury&mdash;helps
the driver in his work. <q>Shall I,</q> he asks, <q>cut the
poles or trim them for thee?</q> <q>Do thou the trimming,</q>
says the driver. Cuchulain takes the poles by
the tops and draws them against the set of the branches
through his toes, and then runs his fingers down them
the same way, and gives them over as smooth and
<pb n='209' id='page209'/>
polished as if they were planed by a carpenter. The
driver stares at him. <q>I doubt this work I set thee to
is not thy proper work,</q> he says. <q>Who art thou
then at all?</q> <q>I am that Cuchulain of whom thou
spakest but now.</q> <q>Surely I am but a dead man,</q>
says the driver. <q>Nay,</q> replies Cuchulain, <q>I slay
not drivers nor messengers nor men unarmed. But run,
tell thy master Orlam that Cuchulain is about to visit
him.</q> The driver runs off, but Cuchulain outstrips
him, meets Orlam first, and strikes off his head. For
a moment the host of Maev see him as he shakes this
bloody trophy before them; then he disappears from
sight&mdash;it is the first glimpse they have caught of their
persecutor.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Battle-Frenzy of Cuchulain</hi>
</p>

<p>
A number of scattered episodes now follow. The
host of Maev spreads out and devastates the territories
of Bregia and of Murthemney, but they cannot advance
further into Ulster. Cuchulain hovers about them
continually, slaying them by twos and threes, and no
man knows where he will swoop next. Maev herself
is awed when, by the bullets of an unseen slinger, a
squirrel and a pet bird are killed as they sit upon her
shoulders. Afterwards, as Cuchulain's wrath grows
fiercer, he descends with supernatural might upon
whole companies of the Connacht host, and hundreds
fall at his onset. The characteristic distortion or
<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>riastradh</foreign> which seized him in his battle-frenzy is then
described. He became a fearsome and multiform creature
such as never was known before. Every particle of
him quivered like a bulrush in a running stream. His
calves and heels and hams shifted to the front, and his
feet and knees to the back, and the muscles of his
neck stood out like the head of a young child. One
<pb n='210' id='page210'/>
eye was engulfed deep in his head, the other protruded,
his mouth met his ears, foam poured from his jaws
like the fleece of a three-year-old wether. The beats
of his heart sounded like the roars of a lion as he rushes
on his prey. A light blazed above his head, and <q>his
hair became tangled about as it had been the branches of
a red thorn-bush stuffed into the gap of a fence....
Taller, thicker, more rigid, longer than the mast of a
great ship was the perpendicular jet of dusky blood
which out of his scalp's very central point shot upwards
and was there scattered to the four cardinal points,
whereby was formed a magic mist of gloom resembling
the smoky pall that drapes a regal dwelling, what time
a king at nightfall of a winter's day draws near to it.</q><note place='foot'><p>
I quote from Standish Hayes O'Grady's translation, in Miss
Hull's <q>Cuchullin Saga.</q>
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Such was the imagery by which Gaelic writers conveyed
the idea of superhuman frenzy. At the sight of
Cuchulain in his paroxysm it is said that once a hundred
of Maev's warriors fell dead from horror.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Compact of the Ford</hi>
</p>

<p>
Maev now tried to tempt him by great largesse to
desert the cause of Ulster, and had a colloquy with
him, the two standing on opposite sides of a glen across
which they talked. She scanned him closely, and was
struck by his slight and boyish appearance. She failed
to move him from his loyalty to Ulster, and death
descends more thickly than ever upon the Connacht
host; the men are afraid to move out for plunder save
in twenties and thirties, and at night the stones from
Cuchulain's sling whistle continually through the camp,
braining or maiming. At last, through the mediation
of Fergus, an agreement was come to. Cuchulain
undertook not to harry the host provided they would
<pb n='211' id='page211'/>
only send against him one champion at a time, whom
Cuchulain would meet in battle at the ford of the River
Dee, which is now called the Ford of Ferdia.<note place='foot' id='p211n1'><p>
<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Ath Fherdia</foreign>, which is pronounced and now spelt <q>Ardee.</q> It
is in Co. Louth, at the southern border of the Plain of Murthemney,
which was Cuchulain's territory.
</p></note> While
each fight was in progress the host might move on, but
when it was ended they must encamp till the morrow
morning. <q>Better to lose one man a day than a
hundred,</q> said Maev, and the pact was made.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Fergus and Cuchulain</hi>
</p>

<p>
Several single combats are then narrated, in which
Cuchulain is always a victor. Maev even persuades
Fergus to go against him, but Fergus and Cuchulain
will on no account fight each other, and Cuchulain, by
agreement with Fergus, pretends to fly before him, on
Fergus's promise that he will do the same for Cuchulain
when required. How this pledge was kept we shall see later.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Capture of the Brown Bull</hi>
</p>

<p>
During one of Cuchulain's duels with a famous
champion, Natchrantal, Maev, with a third of her army,
makes a sudden foray into Ulster and penetrates as far
as Dunseverick, on the northern coast, plundering and
ravaging as they go. The Brown Bull, who was originally
at Quelgny (Co. Down), has been warned at an earlier
stage by the Morrigan<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page126'>p. 126</ref>.
</p></note> to withdraw himself, and he
has taken refuge, with his herd of cows, in a glen of
Slievegallion, Co. Armagh. The raiders of Maev find
him there, and drive him off with the herd in triumph,
passing Cuchulain as they return. Cuchulain slays the
leader of the escort&mdash;Buic son of Banblai&mdash;but cannot
<pb n='212' id='page212'/>
rescue the Bull, and <q>this,</q> it is said, <q>was the greatest
affront put on Cuchulain during the course of the raid.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Morrigan</hi>
</p>

<p>
The raid ought now to have ceased, for its object has
been attained, but by this time the hostings of the four
southern provinces<note place='foot'><p>
In ancient Ireland there were five provinces, Munster being
counted as two, or, as some ancient authorities explain it, the
High King's territory in Meath and Westmeath being reckoned a
separate province.
</p></note> had gathered together under Maev
for the plunder of Ulster, and Cuchulain remained still
the solitary warder of the marches. Nor did Maev
keep her agreement, for bands of twenty warriors at a
time were loosed against him and he had much ado to
defend himself. The curious episode of the fight with
the Morrigan now occurs. A young woman clad in a
mantle of many colours appears to Cuchulain, telling
him that she is a king's daughter, attracted by the tales
of his great exploits, and she has come to offer him her
love. Cuchulain tells her rudely that he is worn and
harassed with war and has no mind to concern himself
with women. <q>It shall go hard with thee,</q> then said
the maid, <q>when thou hast to do with men, and I shall
be about thy feet as an eel in the bottom of the Ford.</q>
Then she and her chariot vanished from his sight and
he saw but a crow sitting on a branch of a tree, and he
knew that he had spoken with the Morrigan.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Fight with Loch</hi>
</p>

<p>
The next champion sent against him by Maev was
Loch son of Mofebis. To meet this hero it is said that
Cuchulain had to stain his chin with blackberry juice so
as to simulate a beard, lest Loch should disdain to do
combat with a boy. So they fought in the Ford, and the
<pb n='213' id='page213'/>
Morrigan came against him in the guise of a white
heifer with red ears, but Cuchulain fractured her eye
with a cast of his spear. Then she came swimming up
the river like a black eel and twisted herself about his
legs, and ere he could rid himself of her Loch wounded
him. Then she attacked him as a grey wolf, and again,
before he could subdue her, he was wounded by Loch.
At this his battle-fury took hold of him and he drove
the Gae Bolg against Loch, splitting his heart in two.
<q>Suffer me to rise,</q> said Loch, <q>that I may fall on my
face on thy side of the ford, and not backward toward
the men of Erin.</q> <q>It is a warrior's boon thou askest,</q>
said Cuchulain, <q>and it is granted.</q> So Loch died; and
a great despondency, it is said, now fell upon Cuchulain,
for he was outwearied with continued fighting, and sorely
wounded, and he had never slept since the beginning
of the raid, save leaning upon his spear; and he sent
his charioteer, Laeg, to see if he could rouse the men of
Ulster to come to his aid at last.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Lugh the Protector</hi>
</p>

<p>
But as he lay at evening by the grave mound of Lerga
in gloom and dejection, watching the camp-fires of the
vast army encamped over against him and the glitter of
their innumerable spears, he saw coming through the
host a tall and comely warrior who strode impetuously
forward, and none of the companies through which he
passed turned his head to look at him or seemed to see
him. He wore a tunic of silk embroidered with gold,
and a green mantle fastened with a silver brooch; in
one hand was a black shield bordered with silver and
two spears in the other. The stranger came to Cuchulain
and spoke gently and sweetly to him of his long toil
and waking, and his sore wounds, and said in the end:
<q>Sleep now, Cuchulain, by the grave in Lerga; sleep
<pb n='214' id='page214'/>
and slumber deeply for three days, and for that time I
will take thy place and defend the Ford against the host
of Maev.</q> Then Cuchulain sank into a profound
slumber and trance, and the stranger laid healing balms
of magical power to his wounds so that he awoke whole
and refreshed, and for the time that Cuchulain slept the
stranger held the Ford against the host. And Cuchulain
knew that this was Lugh his father, who had come from
among the People of Dana to help his son through his
hour of gloom and despair.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Sacrifice of the Boy Corps</hi>
</p>

<p>
But still the men of Ulster lay helpless. Now there
was at Emain Macha a band of thrice fifty boys, the
sons of all the chieftains of the provinces, who were
there being bred up in arms and in noble ways, and these
suffered not from the curse of Macha, for it fell only on
grown men. But when they heard of the sore straits in
which Cuchulain, their playmate not long ago, was lying
they put on their light armour and took their weapons
and went forth for the honour of Ulster, under Conor's
young son, Follaman, to aid him. And Follaman vowed
that he would never return to Emania without the
diadem of Ailell as a trophy. Three times they drove
against the host of Maev, and thrice their own number
fell before them, but in the end they were overwhelmed
and slain, not one escaping alive.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Carnage of Murthemney</hi>
</p>

<p>
This was done as Cuchulain lay in his trance, and
when he awoke, refreshed and well, and heard what had
been done, his frenzy came upon him and he leaped
into his war-chariot and drove furiously round and
round the host of Maev. And the chariot ploughed
the earth till the ruts were like the ramparts of a
<pb n='215' id='page215'/>
fortress, and the scythes upon its wheels caught and
mangled the bodies of the crowded host till they were
piled like a wall around the camp, and as Cuchulain
shouted in his wrath the demons and goblins and wild
things in Erin yelled in answer, so that with the terror
and the uproar the host of men heaved and surged
hither and thither, and many perished from each other's
weapons, and many from horror and fear. And this
was the great carnage, called the Carnage of Murthemney,
that Cuchulain did to avenge the boy-corps of
Emania; six score and ten princes were then slain
of the host of Maev, besides horses and women and
wolf-dogs and common folk without number. It
is said that Lugh mac Ethlinn fought there by his son.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Clan Calatin</hi>
</p>

<p>
Next the men of Erin resolved to send against
Cuchulain, in single combat, the Clan Calatin.<note place='foot'><p>
<q>Clan</q> in Gaelic means children or offspring. Clan Calatin=the 
sons of Calatin.
</p></note> Now
Calatin was a wizard, and he and his seven-and-twenty
sons formed, as it were, but one being, the sons being
organs of their father, and what any one of them did
they all did alike. They were all poisonous, so that
any weapon which one of them used would kill in nine
days the man who was but grazed by it. When this
multiform creature met Cuchulain each hand of it
hurled a spear at once, but Cuchulain caught the twenty-eight
spears on his shield and not one of them drew
blood. Then he drew his sword to lop off the spears
that bristled from his shield, but as he did so the Clan
Calatin rushed upon him and flung him down, thrusting
his face into the gravel. At this Cuchulain gave a
great cry of distress at the unequal combat, and one of
<pb n='216' id='page216'/>
the Ulster exiles, Fiacha son of Firaba, who was with
the host of Maev, and was looking on at the fight,
could not endure to see the plight of the champion, and
he drew his sword and with one stroke he lopped off
the eight-and-twenty hands that were grinding the face
of Cuchulain into the gravel of the Ford. Then
Cuchulain arose and hacked the Clan Calatin into
fragments, so that none survived to tell Maev what
Fiacha had done, else had he and his thirty hundred
followers of Clan Rury been given by Maev to the
edge of the sword.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Ferdia to the Fray</hi>
</p>

<p>
Cuchulain had now overcome all the mightiest of
Maev's men, save only the mightiest of them all after
Fergus, Ferdia son of Daman. And because Ferdia
was the old friend and fellow pupil of Cuchulain he had
never gone out against him; but now Maev begged
him to go, and he would not. Then she offered him
her daughter, Findabair of the Fair Eyebrows, to wife,
if he would face Cuchulain at the Ford, but he would
not. At last she bade him go, lest the poets and
satirists of Erin should make verses on him and put
him to open shame, and then in wrath and sorrow he
consented to go, and bade his charioteer make ready for
to-morrow's fray. Then was gloom among all his
people when they heard of that, for they knew that if
Cuchulain and their master met, one of them would
return alive no more.
</p>

<p>
Very early in the morning Ferdia drove to the Ford,
and lay down there on the cushions and skins of the
chariot and slept till Cuchulain should come. Not till
it was full daylight did Ferdia's charioteer hear the
thunder of Cuchulain's war-car approaching, and then
he woke his master, and the two friends faced each
<pb n='217' id='page217'/>
other across the Ford. And when they had greeted
each other Cuchulain said: <q>It is not thou, O Ferdia,
who shouldst have come to do battle with me. When
we were with Skatha did we not go side by side in
every battle, through every wood and wilderness? were
we not heart-companions, comrades, in the feast and the
assembly? did we not share one bed and one deep
slumber?</q> But Ferdia replied: <q>O Cuchulain, thou
of the wondrous feats, though we have studied poetry
and science together, and though I have heard thee
recite our deeds of friendship, yet it is my hand that
shall wound thee. I bid thee remember not our
comradeship, O Hound of Ulster; it shall not avail
thee, it shall not avail thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
They then debated with what weapons they should
begin the fight, and Ferdia reminded Cuchulain of the
art of casting small javelins that they had learned from
Skatha, and they agreed to begin with these. Backwards
and forwards, then, across the Ford, hummed
the light javelins like bees on a summer's day, but
when noonday had come not one weapon had pierced
the defence of either champion. Then they took to
the heavy missile spears, and now at last blood began
to flow, for each champion wounded the other time and
again. At last the day came to its close. <q>Let us
cease now,</q> said Ferdia, and Cuchulain agreed. Each
then threw his arms to his charioteer, and the friends
embraced and kissed each other three times, and went
to their rest. Their horses were in the same paddock,
their drivers warmed themselves over the same fire, and
the heroes sent each other food and drink and healing
herbs for their wounds.
</p>

<p>
Next day they betook themselves again to the
Ford, and this time, because Ferdia had the choice of
weapons the day before, he bade Cuchulain take it
<pb n='218' id='page218'/>
now.<note place='foot' id='p218n1'><p>
Together with much that is wild and barbaric in this Irish epic
of the <q>Tain</q> the reader will be struck by the ideals of courtesy and
gentleness which not infrequently come to light in it. It must be
remembered that, as Mr. A.H. Leahy points out in his <q>Heroic
Romances of Ireland,</q> the legend of the Raid of Quelgny is, at the very
latest, a century earlier than all other known romances of chivalry,
Welsh or Continental. It is found in the <q>Book of Leinster,</q> a
manuscript of the twelfth century, as well as in other sources, and
was doubtless considerably older than the date of its transcription
there. <q>The whole thing,</q> says Mr. Leahy, <q>stands at the very
beginning of the literature of modern Europe.</q>
</p></note> Cuchulain chose then the heavy, broad-bladed
spears for close fighting, and with them they fought
from the chariots till the sun went down, and drivers
and horses were weary, and the body of each hero was
torn with wounds. Then at last they gave over, and
threw away their weapons. And they kissed each
other as before, and as before they shared all things at
night, and slept peacefully till the morning.
</p>

<p>
When the third day of the combat came Ferdia wore
an evil and lowering look, and Cuchulain reproached
him for coming out in battle against his comrade for
the bribe of a fair maiden, even Findabair, whom Maev
had offered to every champion and to Cuchulain himself
if the Ford might be won thereby; but Ferdia
said: <q>Noble Hound, had I not faced thee when
summoned, my troth would be broken, and there
would be shame on me in Rathcroghan.</q> It is now
the turn of Ferdia to choose the weapons, and they
betake themselves to their <q>heavy, hard-smiting swords,</q>
and though they hew from each other's thighs and
shoulders great cantles of flesh, neither can prevail over
the other, and at last night ends the combat. This time
they parted from each other in heaviness and gloom, and
there was no interchange of friendly acts, and their
drivers and horses slept apart. The passions of the
warriors had now risen to a grim sternness.
</p>

<pb n='219' id='page219'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Death of Ferdia</hi>
</p>

<p>
On the fourth day Ferdia knew the contest would
be decided, and he armed himself with especial care.
Next his skin was a tunic of striped silk bordered with
golden spangles, and over that hung an apron of brown
leather. Upon his belly he laid a flat stone, large as a
millstone, and over that a strong, deep apron of iron,
for he dreaded that Cuchulain would use the Gae Bolg
that day. And he put on his head his crested helmet
studded with carbuncle and inlaid with enamels, and
girt on his golden-hilted sword, and on his left arm
hung his broad shield with its fifty bosses of bronze.
Thus he stood by the Ford, and as he waited he tossed
up his weapons and caught them again and did many
wonderful feats, playing with his mighty weapons as a
juggler plays with apples; and Cuchulain, watching him,
said to Laeg, his driver: <q>If I give ground to-day, do
thou reproach and mock me and spur me on to valour,
and praise and hearten me if I do well, for I shall have
need of all my courage.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Ferdia,</q> said Cuchulain when they met, <q>what
shall be our weapons to-day?</q> <q>It is thy choice to-day,</q>
said Ferdia. <q>Then let it be all or any,</q> said
Cuchulain, and Ferdia was cast down at hearing this, but
he said, <q>So be it,</q> and thereupon the fight began.
Till midday they fought with spears, and none could
gain any advantage over the other. Then Cuchulain
drew his sword and sought to smite Ferdia over the
rim of his shield; but the giant Firbolg flung him off.
Thrice Cuchulain leaped high into the air, seeking to
strike Ferdia over his shield, but each time as he
descended Ferdia caught him upon the shield and flung
him off like a little child into the Ford. And Laeg
mocked him, crying: <q>He casts thee off as a river flings
<pb n='220' id='page220'/>
its foam, he grinds thee as a millstone grinds a corn of
wheat; thou elf, never call thyself a warrior.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then at last Cuchulain's frenzy came upon him, and
he dilated giant-like, till he overtopped Ferdia, and the
hero-light blazed about his head. In close contact the
two were interlocked, whirling and trampling, while the
demons and goblins and unearthly things of the glens
screamed from the edges of their swords, and the waters
of the Ford recoiled in terror from them, so that for a
while they fought on dry land in the midst of the riverbed.
And now Ferdia found Cuchulain a moment off
his guard, and smote him with the edge of the sword,
and it sank deep into his flesh, and all the river ran red
with his blood. And he pressed Cuchulain sorely after
that, hewing and thrusting so that Cuchulain could
endure it no longer, and he shouted to Laeg to fling
him the Gae Bolg. When Ferdia heard that he lowered
his shield to guard himself from below, and Cuchulain
drove his spear over the rim of the shield and through
his breastplate into his chest. And Ferdia raised his
shield again, but in that moment Cuchulain seized the
Gae Bolg in his toes and drove it upward against Ferdia,
and it pierced through the iron apron and burst in three
the millstone that guarded him, and deep into his body
it passed, so that every crevice and cranny of him was
filled with its barbs. <q>'Tis enough,</q> cried Ferdia; <q>I
have my death of that. It is an ill deed that I fall by
thy hand, O Cuchulain.</q> Cuchulain seized him as he
fell, and carried him northward across the Ford, that he
might die on the further side of it, and not on the side
of the men of Erin. Then he laid him down, and a
faintness seized Cuchulain, and he was falling, when
Laeg cried: <q>Rise up, Cuchulain, for the host of Erin
will be upon us. No single combat will they give after
Ferdia has fallen.</q> But Cuchulain said: <q>Why should
<pb n='221' id='page221'/>
I rise again, O my servant, now he that lieth here has
fallen by my hand?</q> and he fell in a swoon like death.
And the host of Maev with tumult and rejoicing, with
tossing of spears and shouting of war-songs, poured
across the border into Ulster.
</p>

<p>
But before they left the Ford they took the body of
Ferdia and laid it in a grave, and built a mound over
him and set up a pillar-stone with his name and lineage
in Ogham. And from Ulster came certain of the
friends of Cuchulain, and they bore him away into
Murthemney, where they washed him and bathed his
wounds in the streams, and his kin among the Danaan
folk cast magical herbs into the rivers for his healing.
But he lay there in weakness and in stupor for many days.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Rousing of Ulster</hi>
</p>

<p>
Now Sualtam, the father of Cuchulain, had taken his
son's horse, the Grey of Macha, and ridden off again to
see if by any means he might rouse the men of Ulster
to defend the province. And he went crying abroad:
<q>The men of Ulster are being slain, the women carried
captive, the kine driven!</q> Yet they stared on him
stupidly, as though they knew not of what he spake.
At last he came to Emania, and there were Cathbad
the Druid and Conor the King, and all their nobles
and lords, and Sualtam cried aloud to them: <q>The
men of Ulster are being slain, the women carried
captive, the kine driven; and Cuchulain alone holds
the gap of Ulster against the four provinces of Erin.
Arise and defend yourselves!</q> But Cathbad only
said: <q>Death were the due of him who thus disturbs
the King</q>; and Conor said: <q>Yet it is true what
the man says</q>; and the lords of Ulster wagged their
heads and murmured: <q>True indeed it is.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Sualtam wheeled round his horse in anger and
<pb n='222' id='page222'/>
was about to depart when, with a start which the Grey
made, his neck fell against the sharp rim of the shield
upon his back, and it shore off his head, and the head
fell on the ground. Yet still it cried its message as it
lay, and at last Conor bade put it on a pillar that it
might be at rest. But it still went on crying and exhorting,
and at length into the clouded mind of the
king the truth began to penetrate, and the glazed eyes
of the warriors began to glow, and slowly the spell of
Macha's curse was lifted from their minds and bodies.
Then Conor arose and swore a mighty oath, saying:
<q>The heavens are above us and the earth beneath us,
and the sea is round about us; and surely, unless the
heavens fall on us and the earth gape to swallow us
up, and the sea overwhelm the earth, I will restore
every woman to her hearth, and every cow to its byre.</q><note place='foot'><p>
Another instance of the survival of the oath formula recited by
the Celtic envoys to Alexander the Great. See <ref target='page23'>p. 23</ref>.
</p></note>
His Druid proclaimed that the hour was propitious,
and the king bade his messengers go forth on every
side and summon Ulster to arms, and he named to
them warriors long dead as well as the living, for the
cloud of the curse still lingered in his brain.
</p>

<p>
With the curse now departed from them the men
of Ulster flocked joyfully to the summons, and on
every hand there was grinding of spears and swords,
and buckling on of armour and harnessing of war-chariots
for the rising-out of the province.<note place='foot'><p>
<q>Rising-out</q> is the vivid expression used by Irish writers for a
clan or territory going on the war-path. <q>Hosting</q> is also used
in a similar sense.
</p></note> One host
came under Conor the King and Keltchar, son of
Uthecar Hornskin, from Emania southwards, and
another from the west along the very track of the host
of Maev. And Conor's host fell upon eight score of
<pb n='223' id='page223'/>
the men of Erin in Meath, who were carrying away a
great booty of women-captives, and they slew every
man of the eight score and rescued the women. Maev
and her host then fell back toward Connacht, but when
they reached Slemon Midi, the Hill of Slane, in Meath,
the Ulster bands joined each other there and prepared
to give battle. Maev sent her messenger mac Roth to
view the Ulster host on the Plain of Garach and report
upon it. Mac Roth came back with an awe-striking
description of what he beheld. When he first looked
he saw the plain covered with deer and other wild
beasts. These, explains Fergus, had been driven out
of the forests by the advancing host of the Ulster men.
The second time mac Roth looked he saw a mist that
filled the valleys, the hill-tops standing above it like
islands. Out of the mist there came thunder and
flashes of light, and a wind that nearly threw him off
his feet. <q>What is this?</q> asks Maev, and Fergus
tells her that the mist is the deep breathing of the
warriors as they march, and the light is the flashing of
their eyes, and the thunder is the clangour of their
war-cars and the clash of their weapons as they go to
the fight: <q>They think they will never reach it,</q> says
Fergus. <q>We have warriors to meet them,</q> says Maev.
<q>You will need that,</q> says Fergus, <q>for in all Ireland,
nay, in all the Western world, to Greece and Scythia and
the Tower of Bregon<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page130'>p. 130</ref>.
</p></note> and the Island of Gades, there live
not who can face the men of Ulster in their wrath.</q>
</p>

<p>
A long passage then follows describing the appearance
and equipment of each of the Ulster chiefs.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Battle of Garach</hi>
</p>

<p>
The battle was joined on the Plain of Garach, in
Meath. Fergus, wielding a two-handed sword, the
<pb n='224' id='page224'/>
sword which, it was said, when swung in battle made
circles like the arch of a rainbow, swept down whole
ranks of the Ulster men at each blow,<note place='foot'><p>
The sword of Fergus was a fairy weapon called the <hi rend='italic'>Caladcholg</hi> 
(hard dinter), a name of which Arthur's more famous <q>Excalibur</q>
is a Latinised corruption.
</p></note> and the fierce
Maev charged thrice into the heart of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Fergus met Conor the King, and smote him on his
golden-bordered shield, but Cormac, the king's son,
begged for his father's life. Fergus then turned on
Conall of the Victories.
</p>

<p>
<q>Too hot art thou,</q> said Conall, <q>against thy people
and thy race for a wanton.</q><note place='foot'><p>
The reference is to Deirdre.
</p></note> Fergus then turned from
slaying the Ulstermen, but in his battle-fury he smote
among the hills with his rainbow-sword, and struck off
the tops of the three <hi rend='italic'>Maela</hi> of Meath, so that they are
flat-topped (<hi rend='italic'>mael</hi>) to this day.
</p>

<p>
Cuchulain in his stupor heard the crash of Fergus's
blows, and coming slowly to himself he asked of Laeg
what it meant. <q>It is the sword-play of Fergus,</q> said
Laeg. Then he sprang up, and his body dilated so that
the wrappings and swathings that had been bound on
him flew off, and he armed himself and rushed into
the battle. Here he met Fergus. <q>Turn hither,
Fergus,</q> he shouted; <q>I will wash thee as foam in a
pool, I will go over thee as the tail goes over a cat, I
will smite thee as a mother smites her infant.</q> <q>Who
speaks thus to me?</q> cried Fergus. <q>Cuchulain mac
Sualtam; and now do thou avoid me as thou art
pledged.</q><note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page211'>p. 211</ref>.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have promised even that,</q> said Fergus, and then
went out of the battle, and with him the men of Leinster
and the men of Munster, leaving Maev with her seven
sons and the hosting of Connacht alone.
</p>

<pb n='225' id='page225'/>

<p>
It was midday when Cuchulain came into the fight;
when the evening sun was shining through the leaves
of the trees his war-chariot was but two wheels and a
handful of shattered ribs, and the host of Connacht was
in full flight towards the border. Cuchulain overtook
Maev, who crouched under her chariot and entreated
grace. <q>I am not wont to slay women,</q> said Cuchulain,
and he protected her till she had crossed the
Shannon at Athlone.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Fight of the Bulls</hi>
</p>

<p>
But the Brown Bull of Quelgny, that Maev had sent
into Connacht by a circuitous way, met the white-horned
Bull of Ailell on the Plain of Aei, and the two beasts
fought; but the Brown Bull quickly slew the other,
and tossed his fragments about the land so that pieces
of him were strewn from Rathcroghan to Tara; and
then careered madly about till he fell dead, bellowing and
vomiting black gore, at the Ridge of the Bull, between
Ulster and Iveagh. Ailell and Maev made peace with
Ulster for seven years, and the Ulster men returned
home to Emain Macha with great glory.
</p>

<p>
Thus ends the <q>Tain Bo Cuailgnè,</q> or Cattle Raid of
Quelgny; and it was written out in the <q>Book of
Leinster</q> in the year 1150 by the hand of Finn mac
Gorman, Bishop of Kildare, and at the end is written:
<q>A blessing on all such as faithfully shall recite the
<q>Tain</q> as it stands here, and shall not give it in any
other form.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Cuchulain in Fairyland</hi>
</p>

<p>
One of the strangest tales in Celtic legend tells how
Cuchulain, as he lay asleep after hunting, against a
pillar-stone, had a vision of two Danaan women who
came to him armed with rods and alternately beat
<pb n='226' id='page226'/>
him till he was all but dead, and he could not lift a
hand to defend himself. Next day, and for a year
thereafter, he lay in sore sickness, and none could heal
him.
</p>

<p>
Then a man whom none knew came and told him to
go to the pillar-stone where he had seen the vision, and
he would learn what was to be done for his recovery.
There he found a Danaan woman in a green mantle,
one of those who had chastised him, and she told him
that Fand, the Pearl of Beauty, wife of Mananan the
Sea-god, had set her love on him; and she was
at enmity with her husband Mananan; and her realm
was besieged by three demon kings, against whom
Cuchulain's help was sought, and the price of his help
would be the love of Fand. Laeg, the charioteer, was
then sent by Cuchulain to report upon Fand and her
message. He entered Fairyland, which lies beyond a
lake across which he passed in a magic boat of bronze,
and came home with a report of Fand's surpassing
beauty and the wonders of the kingdom; and Cuchulain
then betook himself thither. Here he had a battle
in a dense mist with the demons, who are described as
resembling sea-waves&mdash;no doubt we are to understand
that they are the folk of the angry husband, Mananan.
Then he abode with Fand, enjoying all the delights of
Fairyland for a month, after which he bade her farewell,
and appointed a trysting-place on earth, the Strand
of the Yew Tree, where she was to meet him.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Fand, Emer, and Cuchulain</hi>
</p>

<p>
But Emer heard of the tryst; and though not
commonly disturbed at Cuchulain's numerous infidelities,
she came on this occasion with fifty of her
maidens armed with sharp knives to slay Fand. Cuchulain
and Fand perceive their chariots from afar, and
<pb n='227' id='page227'/>
the armed angry women with golden clasps shining on
their breasts, and he prepares to protect his mistress.
He addresses Emer in a curious poem, describing the
beauty and skill and magical powers of Fand&mdash;<q>There
is nothing the spirit can wish for that she has not got.</q>
Emer replies: <q>In good sooth, the lady to whom thou
dost cling seems in no way better than I am, but the
new is ever sweet and the well-known is sour; thou
hast all the wisdom of the time, Cuchulain! Once we
dwelled in honour together, and still might dwell if I
could find favour in thy sight.</q> <q>By my word thou
dost,</q> said Cuchulain, <q>and shalt find it so long as I
live.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give me up,</q> then said Fand. But Emer said:
<q>Nay, it is more fitting that I be the deserted one.</q>
<q>Not so,</q> said Fand; <q>it is I who must go.</q> <q>And
an eagerness for lamentation seized upon Fand, and her
soul was great within her, for it was shame for her to
be deserted and straightway to return to her home;
moreover, the mighty love that she bore to Cuchulain
was tumultuous in her.</q><note place='foot'><p>
A.H. Leahy's translation, <q>Heroic Romances of Ireland,</q> vol. i.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
But Mananan, the Son of the Sea, knew of her
sorrow and her shame, and he came to her aid, none
seeing him but she alone, and she welcomed him in
a mystic song. <q>Wilt thou return to me?</q> said
Mananan, <q>or abide with Cuchulain?</q> <q>In truth,</q>
said Fand, <q>neither of ye is better or nobler than the
other, but I will go with thee, Mananan, for thou hast
no other mate worthy of thee, but that Cuchulain has
in Emer.</q>
</p>

<p>
So she went to Mananan, and Cuchulain, who did
not see the god, asked Laeg what was happening.
<q>Fand,</q> he replied, <q>is going away with the Son of the
Sea, since she hath not been pleasing in thy sight.</q>
</p>

<pb n='228' id='page228'/>

<p>
Then Cuchulain bounded into the air and fled from
the place, and lay a long time refusing meat and drink,
until at last the Druids gave him a draught of forgetfulness;
and Mananan, it is said, shook his cloak
between Cuchulain and Fand, so that they might meet
no more throughout eternity.<note place='foot'><p>
The cloak of Mananan (see <ref target='page125'>p. 125</ref>) typifies the sea&mdash;here, in its
dividing and estranging power.

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Vengeance of Maev</hi>
</p>

<p>
Though Maev made peace with Ulster after the
battle of Garech she vowed the death of Cuchulain for
all the shame and loss he had brought upon her and
on her province, and she sought how she might take
her vengeance upon him.
</p>

<p>
Now the wife of the wizard Calatin, whom Cuchulain
slew at the Ford, brought forth, after her husband's
death, six children at a birth, namely, three sons and
three daughters. Misshapen, hideous, poisonous, born
for evil were they; and Maev, hearing of these, sent
them to learn the arts of magic, not in Ireland only, but
in Alba; and even as far as Babylon they went to seek
for hidden knowledge, and they came back mighty in
their craft, and she loosed them against Cuchulain.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Cuchulain and Blanid</hi>
</p>

<p>
Besides the Clan Calatin, Cuchulain had also other
foes, namely Ere, the King of Ireland, son to Cairpre,
whom Cuchulain had slain in battle, and Lewy son of
Curoi, King of Munster.<note place='foot'><p>
This Curoi appears in various tales of the Ultonian Cycle with
attributes which show that he was no mortal king, but a local deity.
</p></note> For Curoi's wife, Blanid,
had set her love on Cuchulain, and she bade him come
and take her from Curoi's dūn, and watch his time to
<pb n='229' id='page229'/>
attack the dūn, when he would see the stream that
flowed from it turn white. So Cuchulain and his men
waited in a wood hard by till Blanid judged that the
time was fit, and she then poured into the stream the
milk of three cows. Then Cuchulain attacked the
dūn, and took it by surprise, and slew Curoi, and bore
away the woman. But Fercartna, the bard of Curoi,
went with them and showed no sign, till, finding himself
near Blanid as she stood near the cliff-edge of
Beara, he flung his arms round her, and leaped with
her over the cliff, and so they perished, and Curoi was
avenged upon his wife.
</p>

<p>
All these now did Maev by secret messages and by
taunts and exhortations arouse against Cuchulain, and
they waited till they heard that the curse of Macha was
again heavy on the men of Ulster, and then they assembled
a host and marched to the Plain of Murthemney.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Madness of Cuchulain</hi>
</p>

<p>
And first the Children of Calatin caused a horror and
a despondency to fall upon the mind of Cuchulain,
and out of the hooded thistles and puff-balls and
fluttering leaves of the forest they made the semblance
of armed battalions marching against Murthemney, and
Cuchulain seemed to see on every side the smoke of
burning dwellings going up. And for two days he did
battle with the phantoms till he was sick and wearied
out. Then Cathbad and the men of Ulster persuaded
him to retire to a solitary glen, where fifty of the
princesses of Ulster, and among them Niam, wife of his
faithful friend Conall of the Victories, tended him, and
Niam made him vow that he would not leave the dūn
where he was until she gave him leave.
</p>

<p>
But still the Children of Calatin filled the land with
apparitions of war, and smoke and flames went up, and
<pb n='230' id='page230'/>
wild cries and wailings with chattering, goblin laughter
and the braying of trumpets and horns were borne
upon the winds. And Bave, Calatin's daughter, went
into the glen, and, taking the form of a handmaid of
Niam, she beckoned her away and led her to a distance
among the woods and put a spell of straying on her so
that she was lost and could find her way home no
more. Bave then went in the form of Niam to
Cuchulain and bade him up and rescue Ulster from the
hosts that were harrying it, and the Morrigan came in
the form of a great crow where Cuchulain sat with the
women, and croaked of war and slaughter. Then
Cuchulain sprang up and called Laeg to harness his
chariot. But when Laeg sought for the Grey of
Macha to harness him, the horse fled from him, and
resisted, and only with great difficulty could Laeg yoke
him in the chariot, while large tears of dark blood
trickled down his face.
</p>

<p>
Then Cuchulain, having armed himself, drove forth;
and on every side shapes and sounds of dread assailed
him and clouded his mind, and then it appeared to
him that he saw a great smoke, lit with bursts of red
flame, over the ramparts of Emain Macha, and he
thought he saw the corpse of Emer tossed out over
the ramparts. But when he came to his dūn at
Murthemney, there was Emer living, and she entreated
him to leave the phantoms alone, but he would not
listen to her, and he bade her farewell. Then he bade
farewell to his mother Dectera, and she gave him a
goblet of wine to drink, but ere he could drink it the
wine turned to blood, and he flung it away, saying, <q>My
life's end is near; this time I shall not return alive from
the battle.</q> And Dectera and Cathbad besought him to
await the coming of Conall of the Victories, who was
away on a journey, but he would not.
</p>


<pb n='231' id='page231'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Washer at the Ford</hi>
</p>

<p>
When he came to the ford upon the plain of
Emania he saw there kneeling by the stream as it were
a young maiden, weeping and wailing, and she washed
a heap of bloody raiment and warlike arms in the
stream, and when she raised a dripping vest or corselet
from the water Cuchulain saw that they were his own.
And as they crossed the ford she vanished from their
sight.<note place='foot'><p>
This apparition of the Washer of the Ford is of frequent
occurrence in Irish legend.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Clan Calatin Again</hi>
</p>

<p>
Then, having taken his leave of Conor and of the
womenfolk in Emania, he turned again towards Murthemney
and the foe. But on his way he saw by the
roadside three old crones, each blind of one eye,
hideous and wretched, and they had made a little fire
of sticks, and over it they were roasting a dead dog
on spits of rowan wood. As Cuchulain passed they
called to him to alight and stay with them and share
their food. <q>That will I not, in sooth,</q> said he.
<q>Had we a great feast,</q> they said, <q>thou wouldst
soon have stayed; it doth not become the great to
despise the small.</q> Then Cuchulain, because he would
not be thought discourteous to the wretched, lighted
down, and he took a piece of the roast and ate it, and
the hand with which he took it was stricken up to the
shoulder so that its former strength was gone. For it
was <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign> to Cuchulain to approach a cooking hearth and
take food from it, and it was <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign> to him to eat of his
namesake.<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page164'>p. 164</ref> for the reference to <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign>. <q>His namesake</q> refers,

</p>

<pb n='232' id='page232'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Death of Cuchulain</hi>
</p>

<p>
Near to Slieve Fuad, south of Armagh, Cuchulain
found the host of his enemies, and drove furiously
against them, plying the champion's <q>thunder-feat</q>
upon them until the plain was strewn with their dead.
Then a satirist, urged on by Lewy, came near him and
demanded his spear.<note place='foot'><p>
It was a point of honour to refuse nothing to a bard; one king
is said to have given his eye when it was demanded of him.
</p></note> <q>Have it, then,</q> said Cuchulain,
and flung it at him with such force that it went clean
through him and killed nine men beyond. <q>A king
will fall by that spear,</q> said the Children of Calatin to
Lewy, and Lewy seized it and flung it at Cuchulain,
but it smote Laeg, the king of charioteers, so that his
bowels fell out on the cushions of the chariot, and he
bade farewell to his master and he died.
</p>

<p>
Then another satirist demanded the spear, and
Cuchulain said: <q>I am not bound to grant more than
one request on one day.</q> But the satirist said: <q>Then
I will revile Ulster for thy default,</q> and Cuchulain flung
him the spear as before, and Ere now got it, and this time
in flying back it struck the Grey of Macha with a mortal
wound. Cuchulain drew out the spear from the horse's
side, and they bade each other farewell, and the Grey
galloped away with half the yoke hanging to its neck.
</p>

<p>
And a third time Cuchulain flung the spear to a satirist,
and Lewy took it again and flung it back, and it struck
Cuchulain, and his bowels fell out in the chariot, and
the remaining horse, Black Sainglend, broke away and
left him.
</p>

<p>
<q>I would fain go as far as to that loch-side to drink,</q>
said Cuchulain, knowing the end was come, and they
suffered him to go when he had promised to return to
them again. So he gathered up his bowels into his
<pb n='233' id='page233'/>
breast and went to the loch-side, and drank, and bathed
himself, and came forth again to die. Now there was
close by a tall pillar-stone that stood westwards of the
loch, and he went up to it and slung his girdle over it and
round his breast, so that he might die in his standing
and not in his lying down; and his blood ran down in
a little stream into the loch, and an otter came out of
the loch and lapped it. And the host gathered round,
but feared to approach him while the life was still in
him, and the hero-light shone above his brow. Then
came the Grey of Macha to protect him, scattering his
foes with biting and kicking.
</p>

<p>
And then came a crow and settled on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Lewy, when he saw this, drew near and pulled the
hair of Cuchulain to one side over his shoulder,
and with his sword he smote off his head; and the
sword fell from Cuchulain's hand, and smote off the
hand of Lewy as it fell. They took the hand of
Cuchulain in revenge for this, and bore the head and
hand south to Tara, and there buried them, and over
them they raised a mound. But Conall of the Victories,
hastening to Cuchulain's side on the news of the war,
met the Grey of Macha streaming with blood, and
together they went to the loch-side and saw him headless
and bound to the pillar-stone, and the horse
came and laid its head on his breast. Conall drove
southwards to avenge Cuchulain, and he came on Lewy
by the river Liffey, and because Lewy had but one
hand Conall tied one of his behind his back, and for
half the day they fought, but neither could prevail.
Then came Conall's horse, the Dewy-Red, and tore a
piece out of Lewy's side, and Conall slew him, and
took his head, and returned to Emain Macha. But
they made no show of triumph in entering the city, for
Cuchulain the Hound of Ulster was no more.

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Recovery of the Tain</hi>
</p>

<p>
The history of the <q>Tain,</q> or Cattle Raid, of Quelgny
was traditionally supposed to have been written by no
other than Fergus mac Roy, but for a long time the
great lay or saga was lost. It was believed to have
been written out in Ogham characters on staves of
wood, which a bard who possessed them had taken with
him into Italy, whence they never returned.
</p>

<p>
The recovery of the <q>Tain</q> was the subject of a number
of legends which Sir S. Ferguson, in his <q>Lays of the
Western Gael,</q> has combined in a poem of so much
power, so much insight into the spirit of Gaelic myth,
that I venture to reproduce much of it here in telling
this singular and beautiful story. It is said that after
the loss of the <q>Tain</q> Sanchan Torpest, chief bard of
Ireland, was once taunted at a feast by the High King
Guary on his inability to recite the most famous and
splendid of Gaelic poems. This touched the bard to
the quick, and he resolved to recover the lost treasure.
Far and wide through Erin and through Alba he
searched for traces of the lay, but could only recover
scattered fragments. He would have conjured up by
magic arts the spirit of Fergus to teach it to him,
even at the cost of his own life&mdash;for such, it seems,
would have been the price demanded for the intervention
and help of the dead&mdash;but the place of Fergus's
grave, where the spells must be said, could not be
discovered. At last Sanchan sent his son Murgen with
his younger brother Eimena to journey to Italy and
endeavour to discover there the fate of the staff-book.
The brothers set off on their journey.

the sake of the recovery of the <q>Tain,</q> to give his life,
and abandon his kin and friends and the maiden he
loves, so that his father might no more be shamed.
But Fergus gave no sign, and Murgen tried another

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Phantom Chariot of Cuchulain</hi>
</p>

<p>
Cuchulain, however, makes an impressive reappearance
in a much later legend of Christian origin, found in the
twelfth-century <q>Book of the Dun Cow.</q> He was
summoned from Hell, we are told, by St. Patrick to prove
<pb n='239' id='page239'/>
the truths of Christianity and the horrors of damnation
to the pagan monarch, Laery mac Neill, King of
Ireland. Laery, with St. Benen, a companion of Patrick,
are standing on the Plain of mac Indoc when a blast
of icy wind nearly takes them off their feet. It is the
wind of Hell, Benen explains, after its opening before
Cuchulain. Then a dense mist covers the plain, and
anon a huge phantom chariot with galloping horses, a
grey and a black, loom up through the mist. Within
it are the famous two, Cuchulain and his charioteer,
giant figures, armed with all the splendour of the Gaelic
warrior.
</p>

<p>
Cuchulain then talks to Laery, and urges him to
<q>believe in God and in holy Patrick, for it is not a
demon that has come to thee, but Cuchulain son of
Sualtam.</q> To prove his identity he recounts his famous
deeds of arms, and ends by a piteous description of his
present state:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>What I suffered of trouble,</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>O Laery, by sea and land&mdash;</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>Yet more severe was a single night</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>When the demon was wrathful!</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>Great as was my heroism,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>Hard as was my sword,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>The devil crushed me with one finger</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'><q rend='pre: none'>Into the red charcoal!</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
He ends by beseeching Patrick that heaven may be
granted to him, and the legend tells that the prayer
was granted and that Laery believed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Death of Conor mac Nessa</hi>
</p>

<p>
Christian ideas have also gathered round the end of
Cuchulain's lord, King Conor of Ulster. The manner
of his death was as follows: An unjust and cruel attack
had been made by him on Mesgedra, King of Leinster,
<pb n='240' id='page240'/>
in which that monarch met his death at the hand of
Conall of the Victories.<note place='foot'><p>
The story is told in full in the author's <q>High Deeds of Finn.</q>
</p></note> Conall took out the brains
of the dead king and mingled them with lime to make
a sling-stone&mdash;such <q>brain balls,</q> as they were called,
being accounted the most deadly of missiles. This ball
was laid up in the king's treasure-house at Emain
Macha, where the Connacht champion, Ket son of
Maga, found it one day when prowling in disguise
through Ulster. Ket took it away and kept it always
by him. Not long thereafter the Connacht men took a
spoil of cattle from Ulster, and the Ulster men, under
Conor, overtook them at a river-ford still called
Athnurchar (The Ford of the Sling-cast), in Westmeath.
A battle was imminent, and many of the ladies of
Connacht came to their side of the river to view the
famous Ultonian warriors, and especially Conor, the
stateliest man of his time. Conor was willing to show
himself, and seeing none but women on the other bank
he drew near them; but Ket, who was lurking in
ambush, now rose and slung the brain-ball at Conor,
striking him full in the forehead. Conor fell, and was
carried off by his routed followers. When they got
him home, still living, to Emain Macha, his physician,
Fingen, pronounced that if the ball were extracted from
his head he must die; it was accordingly sewn up with
golden thread, and the king was bidden to keep himself
from horse-riding and from all vehement passion
and exertion, and he would do well.
</p>

<p>
Seven years afterwards Conor saw the sun darken at
noonday, and he summoned his Druid to tell him the
cause of the portent. The Druid, in a magic trance,
tells him of a hill in a distant land on which stand
three crosses with a human form nailed to each of them,
and one of them is like the Immortals. <q>Is he a
<pb n='241' id='page241'/>
malefactor?</q> then asks Conor. <q>Nay,</q> says the
Druid, <q>but the Son of the living God,</q> and he relates
to the king the story of the death of Christ. Conor
breaks out in fury, and drawing his sword he hacks at
the oak-trees in the sacred grove, crying, <q>Thus would
I deal with his enemies,</q> when with the excitement and
exertion the brain-ball bursts from his head, and he
falls dead. And thus was the vengeance of Mesgedra
fulfilled. With Conor and with Cuchulain the glory of
the Red Branch and the dominance of Ulster passed
away. The next, or Ossianic, cycle of Irish legend brings
upon the scene different characters, different physical
surroundings, and altogether different ideals of life.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Ket and the Boar of mac Datho</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Connacht champion Ket, whose main exploit
was the wounding of King Conor at Ardnurchar, figures
also in a very dramatic tale entitled <q>The Carving of
mac Datho's Boar.</q> The story runs as follows:
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time there dwelt in the province of
Leinster a wealthy hospitable lord named Mesroda, son
of Datho. Two possessions had he; namely, a hound
which could outrun every other hound and every wild
beast in Erin, and a boar which was the finest and
greatest in size that man had ever beheld.
</p>

<p>
Now the fame of this hound was noised all about the
land, and many were the princes and lords who longed
to possess it. And it came to pass that Conor King of
Ulster and Maev Queen of Connacht sent messengers to
mac Datho to ask him to sell them the hound for a price,
and both the messengers arrived at the dūn of mac
Datho on the same day. Said the Connacht messenger:
<q>We will give thee in exchange for the hound six
hundred milch cows, and a chariot with two horses, the
best that are to be found in Connacht, and at the end
<pb n='242' id='page242'/>
of a year thou shalt have as much again.</q> And the
messenger of King Conor said: <q>We will give no less
than Connacht, and the friendship and alliance of Ulster,
and that will be better for thee than the friendship of
Connacht.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Mesroda mac Datho fell silent, and for three
days he would not eat or drink, nor could he sleep o'
nights, but tossed restlessly on his bed. His wife
observed his condition, and said to him: <q>Thy fast hath
been long, Mesroda, though good food is by thee in
plenty; and at night thou turnest thy face to the wall,
and well I know thou dost not sleep. What is the
cause of thy trouble?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is a saying,</q> replied Mac Datho, <q>'Trust
not a thrall with money, nor a woman with a secret.'</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When should a man talk to a woman,</q> said his wife,
<q>but when something were amiss? What thy mind
cannot solve perchance another's may.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then mac Datho told his wife of the request for his
hound both from Ulster and from Connacht at one and
the same time. <q>And whichever of them I deny,</q> he
said, <q>they will harry my cattle and slay my people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then hear my counsel,</q> said the woman. <q>Give
it to both of them, and bid them come and fetch it;
and if there be any harrying to be done, let them even
harry each other; but in no way mayest thou keep the hound.</q>
</p>

<p>
Mac Datho followed this wise counsel, and bade both
Ulster and Connacht to a great feast on the same day,
saying to each of them that they could have the hound
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
So on the appointed day Conor of Ulster, and Maev,
and their retinues of princes and mighty men assembled
at the dūn of mac Datho. There they found a great
feast set forth, and to provide the chief dish mac Datho
<pb n='243' id='page243'/>
had killed his famous boar, a beast of enormous size.
The question now arose as to who should have the
honourable task of carving it, and Bricriu of the Poisoned
Tongue characteristically, for the sake of the strife which
he loved, suggested that the warriors of Ulster and
Connacht should compare their principal deeds of arms,
and give the carving of the boar to him who seemed to
have done best in the border-fighting which was always
going on between the provinces. After much bandying
of words and of taunts Ket son of Maga arises and
stands over the boar, knife in hand, challenging each of
the Ulster lords to match his deeds of valour. One
after another they arise, Cuscrid son of Conor, Keltchar,
Moonremur, Laery the Triumphant, and others&mdash;Cuchulain
is not introduced in this story&mdash;and in each
case Ket has some biting tale to tell of an encounter in
which he has come off better than they, and one by
one they sit down shamed and silenced. At last a shout
of welcome is heard at the door of the hall and the Ulstermen
grow jubilant: Conall of the Victories has appeared
on the scene. He strides up to the boar, and Ket and
he greet each other with chivalrous courtesy:
</p>

<p>
<q>And now welcome to thee, O Conall, thou of the
iron heart and fiery blood; keen as the glitter of ice,
ever-victorious chieftain; hail, mighty son of Finnchoom!</q> 
said Ket.
</p>

<p>
And Conall said: <q>Hail to thee, Ket, flower of heroes,
lord of chariots, a raging sea in battle; a strong, majestic
bull; hail, son of Maga!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And now,</q> went on Conall, <q>rise up from the boar
and give me place.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why so?</q> replied Ket.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dost thou seek a contest from me?</q> said Conall.
<q>Verily thou shalt have it. By the gods of my nation
I swear that since I first took weapons in my hand I
<pb n='244' id='page244'/>
have never passed one day that I did not slay a Connacht
man, nor one night that I did not make a foray on them,
nor have I ever slept but I had the head of a Connacht
man under my knee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I confess,</q> then said Ket, <q>that thou art a better
man than I, and I yield thee the boar. But if Anluan
my brother were here, he would match thee deed for
deed, and sorrow and shame it is that he is not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Anluan is here,</q> shouted Conall, and with that he
drew from his girdle the head of Anluan and dashed it
in the face of Ket.
</p>

<p>
Then all sprang to their feet and a wild shouting and
tumult arose, and the swords flew out of themselves,
and battle raged in the hall of mac Datho. Soon the
hosts burst out through the doors of the dūn and smote
and slew each other in the open field, until the Connacht
host were put to flight. The hound of mac Datho
pursued the chariot of King Ailell of Connacht till the
charioteer smote off its head, and so the cause of contention
was won by neither party, and mac Datho lost
his hound, but saved his lands and life.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Death of Ket</hi>
</p>

<p>
The death of Ket is told in Keating's <q>History of
Ireland.</q> Returning from a foray in Ulster, he was overtaken
by Conall at the place called the Ford of Ket, and
they fought long and desperately. At last Ket was slain,
but Conall of the Victories was in little better case, and
lay bleeding to death when another Connacht champion
named Beälcu<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Bay-al-koo.</q>
</p></note> found him. <q>Kill me,</q> said Conall
to him, <q>that it be not said I fell at the hand of <hi rend='italic'>one</hi> 
Connacht man.</q> But Beälcu said: <q>I will not slay a
man at the point of death, but I will bring thee home
and heal thee, and when thy strength is come again
<pb n='245' id='page245'/>
thou shalt fight with me in single combat.</q> Then
Beälcu put Conall on a litter and brought him home,
and had him tended till his wounds were healed.
</p>

<p>
The three sons of Beälcu, however, when they saw
what the Ulster champion was like in all his might,
resolved to assassinate him before the combat should
take place. By a stratagem Conall contrived that they
slew their own father instead; and then, taking the heads
of the three sons, he went back, victoriously as he was
wont, to Ulster.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Death of Maev</hi>
</p>

<p>
The tale of the death of Queen Maev is also preserved
by Keating. Fergus mac Roy having been slain by
Ailell with a cast of a spear as he bathed in a lake with
Maev, and Ailell having been slain by Conall, Maev
retired to an island<note place='foot'><p>
Inis Clothrann, now known as Quaker's Island. The pool no
longer exists.
</p></note> on Loch Ryve, where she was wont
to bathe early every morning in a pool near to the landing-place.
Forbay son of Conor mac Nessa, having discovered
this habit of the queen's, found means one day
to go unperceived to the pool and to measure the distance
from it to the shore of the mainland. Then he went
back to Emania, where he measured out the distance thus
obtained, and placing an apple on a pole at one end he
shot at it continually with a sling until he grew so good
a marksman at that distance that he never missed his
aim. Then one day, watching his opportunity by the
shores of Loch Ryve, he saw Maev enter the water, and
putting a bullet in his sling he shot at her with so good
an aim that he smote her in the centre of the forehead
and she fell dead.
</p>

<p>
The great warrior-queen had reigned in Connacht, it
was said, for eighty-eight years. She is a signal example
<pb n='246' id='page246'/>
of the kind of women whom the Gaelic bards delighted to
portray. Gentleness and modesty were by no means
their usual characteristics, but rather a fierce overflowing
life. Women-warriors like Skatha and Aifa are frequently
met with, and one is reminded of the Gaulish women,
with their mighty snow-white arms, so dangerous to
provoke, of whom classical writers tell us. The Gaelic
bards, who in so many ways anticipated the ideas of
chivalric romance, did not do so in setting women in a
place apart from men. Women were judged and treated
like men, neither as drudges nor as goddesses, and we
know that well into historic times they went with men
into battle, a practice only ended in the sixth century.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Fergus mac Leda and the Wee Folk</hi>
</p>

<p>
Of the stories of the Ultonian Cycle which do not
centre on the figure of Cuchulain, one of the most
interesting is that of Fergus mac Leda and the King of
the Wee Folk. In this tale Fergus appears as King of
Ulster, but as he was contemporary with Conor mac
Nessa, and in the Cattle Raid of Quelgny is represented
as following him to war, we must conclude that
he was really a sub-king, like Cuchulain or Owen of

Ferney.
</p>

<p>
The tale opens in Faylinn, or the Land of the Wee
Folk, a race of elves presenting an amusing parody of
human institutions on a reduced scale, but endowed
(like dwarfish people generally in the literature of
primitive races) with magical powers. Iubdan,<note place='foot'><p>
<q>Youb´dan.</q>
</p></note> the
King of Faylinn, when flushed with wine at a feast, is
bragging of the greatness of his power and the invincibility
of his armed forces&mdash;have they not the strong
man Glower, who with his axe has been known to hew
down a thistle at a stroke? But the king's bard,
<pb n='247' id='page247'/>
Eisirt, has heard something of a giant race oversea in
a land called Ulster, one man of whom would annihilate
a whole battalion of the Wee Folk, and he
incautiously allows himself to hint as much to the
boastful monarch. He is immediately clapped into
prison for his audacity, and only gets free by promising
to go immediately to the land of the mighty
men, and bring back evidence of the truth of his
incredible story.
</p>

<p>
So off he goes; and one fine day King Fergus and
his lords find at the gate of their Dūn a tiny little fellow
magnificently clad in the robes of a royal bard, who
demands entrance. He is borne in upon the hand of
Æda, the king's dwarf and bard, and after charming the
court by his wise and witty sayings, and receiving a
noble largesse, which he at once distributes among the
poets and other court attendants of Ulster, he goes off
home, taking with him as a guest the dwarf Æda,
before whom the Wee Folk fly as a <q>Fomorian giant,</q>
although, as Eisirt explains, the average man of Ulster
can carry him like a child. Iubdan is now convinced,
but Eisirt puts him under <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign>, the bond of chivalry
which no Irish chieftain can repudiate without being
shamed, to go himself, as Eisirt has done, to the palace
of Fergus and taste the king's porridge. Iubdan, after
he has seen Æda, is much dismayed, but he prepares to
go, and bids Bebo, his wife, accompany him. <q>You
did an ill deed,</q> she says, <q>when you condemned
Eisirt to prison; but surely there is no man under the
sun that can make thee hear reason.</q>
</p>

<p>
So off they go, and Iubdan's fairy steed bears them
over the sea till they reach Ulster, and by midnight
they stand before the king's palace. <q>Let us taste the
porridge as we were bound,</q> says Bebo, <q>and make
off before daybreak.</q> They steal in and find the
<pb n='248' id='page248'/>
porridge-pot, to the rim of which Iubdan can only
reach by standing on his horse's back. In straining
downwards to get at the porridge he overbalances
himself and falls in. There in the thick porridge he
sticks fast, and there Fergus's scullions find him at
the break of day, with the faithful Bebo lamenting.
They bear him off to Fergus, who is amazed at finding
another wee man, with a woman too, in his palace.
He treats them hospitably, but refuses all appeals to
let them go. The story now recounts in a spirit of
broad humour several Rabelaisian adventures in which
Bebo is concerned, and gives a charming poem supposed
to have been uttered by Iubdan in the form of
advice to Fergus's fire-gillie as to the merits for burning
of different kinds of timber. The following are
extracts:
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>Burn not the sweet apple-tree of drooping branches, of the white
blossoms, to whose gracious head each man puts forth his hand.</q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>Burn not the noble willow, the unfailing ornament of poems;
bees drink from its blossoms, all delight in the graceful tent.</q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>The delicate, airy tree of the Druids, the rowan with its berries,
this burn; but avoid the weak tree, burn not the slender hazel.</q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>The ash-tree of the black buds burn not&mdash;timber that speeds
the wheel, that yields the rider his switch; the ashen spear is the
scale-beam of battle.</q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
At last the Wee Folk come in a great multitude to
beg the release of Iubdan. On the king's refusal they
visit the country with various plagues, snipping off the
ears of corn, letting the calves suck all the cows dry,
defiling the wells, and so forth; but Fergus is obdurate.
In their quality as earth-gods, <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>dei terreni</foreign>, they promise
to make the plains before the palace of Fergus stand
thick with corn every year without ploughing or sowing,
<pb n='249' id='page249'/>
but all is vain. At last, however, Fergus agrees to
ransom Iubdan against the best of his fairy treasures,
so Iubdan recounts them&mdash;the cauldron that can never
be emptied, the harp that plays of itself; and finally
he mentions a pair of water-shoes, wearing which
a man can go over or under water as freely as on
dry land. Fergus accepts the shoes, and Iubdan is
released.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Blemish of Fergus</hi>
</p>

<p>
But it is hard for a mortal to get the better of Fairyland&mdash;a
touch of hidden malice lurks in magical gifts,
and so it proved now. Fergus was never tired of
exploring the depths of the lakes and rivers of Ireland;
but one day, in Loch Rury, he met with a hideous
monster, the <hi rend='italic'>Muirdris</hi>, or river-horse, which inhabited
that lake, and from which he barely saved himself by
flying to the shore. With the terror of this encounter
his face was twisted awry; but since a blemished man
could not hold rule in Ireland, his queen and nobles
took pains, on some pretext, to banish all mirrors from
the palace, and kept the knowledge of his condition
from him. One day, however, he smote a bondmaid
with a switch, for some negligence, and the maid, indignant,
cried out: <q>It were better for thee, Fergus, to
avenge thyself on the river-horse that hath twisted thy
face than to do brave deeds on women!</q> Fergus
bade fetch him a mirror, and looked in it. <q>It is true,</q>
he said; <q>the river-horse of Loch Rury has done this
thing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Death of Fergus</hi>
</p>

<p>
The conclusion may be given in the words of Sir
Samuel Ferguson's fine poem on this theme. Fergus
<pb n='250' id='page250'/>
donned the magic shoes, took sword in hand, and went
to Loch Rury:
</p>

<lg>
<l rend='margin-left: 17'><q rend='post: none'>For a day and night</q></l>
<l>Beneath the waves he rested out of sight,</l>
<l>But all the Ultonians on the bank who stood</l>

<l>When next at sunrise skies grew also red</l>
<l>He rose&mdash;and in his hand the <hi rend='italic'>Muirdris</hi>' head.</l>
<l>Gone was the blemish! On his goodly face</l>
<l>Each trait symmetric had resumed its place:</l>
<l>And they who saw him marked in all his mien</l>
<l>A king's composure, ample and serene.</l>
<l>He smiled; he cast his trophy to the bank,</l>
<l>Said, 'I, survivor, Ulstermen!' and sank."</l>
</lg>

<p>
This fine tale has been published in full from an
Egerton MS., by Mr. Standish Hayes O'Grady, in his
<q>Silva Gadelica.</q> The humorous treatment of the
fairy element in the story would mark it as belonging
to a late period of Irish legend, but the tragic and
noble conclusion unmistakably signs it as belonging
to the Ulster bardic literature, and it falls within the
same order of ideas, if it were not composed within the
same period, as the tales of Cuchulain.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Significance of Irish Place-Names</hi>
</p>

<p>
Before leaving this great cycle of legendary literature
let us notice what has already, perhaps, attracted the
attention of some readers&mdash;the extent to which its chief
characters and episodes have been commemorated in
the still surviving place-names of the country.<note place='foot'><p>
Dr. P. W. Joyce's <q>Irish Names of Places</q> is a storehouse of
information on this subject.
</p></note> This
is true of Irish legend in general&mdash;it is especially so of
the Ultonian Cycle. Faithfully indeed, through many
a century of darkness and forgetting, have these names
pointed to the hidden treasures of heroic romance
<pb n='251' id='page251'/>
which the labours of our own day are now restoring to
light. The name of the little town of Ardee, as we
have seen,<note place='foot'><p>
<ref target='p211n1'>P. 211, <hi rend='italic'>note</hi></ref>.
</p></note> commemorates the tragic death of Ferdia at
the hand of his <q>heart companion,</q> the noblest hero of
the Gael. The ruins of Dūn Baruch, where Fergus
was bidden to the treacherous feast, still look over the
waters of Moyle, across which Naisi and Deirdre sailed
to their doom. Ardnurchar, the Hill of the Sling-cast,
in Westmeath,<note place='foot'><p>
The name is given both to the hill, <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>ard</foreign>, and to the ford, <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>atha</foreign>
beneath it.
</p></note> brings to mind the story of the
stately monarch, the crowd of gazing women, and the
crouching enemy with the deadly missile which bore
the vengeance of Mesgedra. The name of Armagh, or
Ard Macha, the Hill of Macha, enshrines the memory
of the Fairy Bride and her heroic sacrifice, while the
grassy rampart can still be traced where the war-goddess
in the earlier legend drew its outline with the pin of her
brooch when she founded the royal fortress of Ulster.
Many pages might be filled with these instances. Perhaps
no modern country has place-names so charged
with legendary associations as are those of Ireland.
Poetry and myth are there still closely wedded to the
very soil of the land&mdash;a fact in which there lies ready
to hand an agency for education, for inspiration, of the
noblest kind, if we only had the insight to see it and
the art to make use of it.

<head>CHAPTER VI: TALES OF THE
OSSIANIC CYCLE</head>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Fianna of Erin</hi>
</p>

<p>
As the tales of the Ultonian Cycle cluster round
the heroic figure of the Hound of Cullan, so do
those of the Ossianic Cycle round that of Finn
mac Cumhal,<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>mac Cool.</q>
</p></note> whose son Oisīn<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Usheen.</q>
</p></note> (or Ossian, as Macpherson
called him in the pretended translations from the
Gaelic which first introduced him to the English-speaking
world) was a poet as well as a warrior, and is the traditional
author of most of them. The events of the
Ultonian Cycle are supposed to have taken place about
the time of the birth of Christ. Those of the Ossianic
Cycle fell mostly in the reign of Cormac mac Art, who
lived in the third century A.D. During his reign the
Fianna of Erin, who are represented as a kind of military
Order composed mainly of the members of two clans,
Clan Bascna and Clan Morna, and who were supposed
to be devoted to the service of the High King and to
the repelling of foreign invaders, reached the height of
their renown under the captaincy of Finn.
</p>

<p>
The annalists of ancient Ireland treated the story of
Finn and the Fianna, in its main outlines, as sober history.
This it can hardly be. Ireland had no foreign invaders
during the period when the Fianna are supposed to have
flourished, and the tales do not throw a ray of light on
the real history of the country; they are far more
concerned with a Fairyland populated by supernatural
beings, beautiful or terrible, than with any tract of real
earth inhabited by real men and women. The modern
critical reader of these tales will soon feel that it would
be idle to seek for any basis of fact in this glittering
<pb n='253' id='page253'/>
mirage. But the mirage was created by poets and storytellers
of such rare gifts for this kind of literature that
it took at once an extraordinary hold on the imagination
of the Irish and Scottish Gael.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Ossianic Cycle</hi>
</p>

<p>
The earliest tales of this cycle now extant are found
in manuscripts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and
were composed probably a couple of centuries earlier.
But the cycle lasted in a condition of vital growth for a
thousand years, right down to Michael Comyn's <q>Lay
of Oisin in the Land of Youth,</q> which was composed
about 1750, and which ended the long history of Gaelic
literature.<note place='foot'><p>
Subject, of course, to the possibility that the present revival of
Gaelic as a spoken tongue may lead to the opening of a new chapter
in that history.
</p></note> It has been estimated<note place='foot'><p>
See <q>Ossian and Ossianic Literature,</q> by Alfred Nutt, p. 4.
</p></note> that if all the tales
and poems of the Ossianic Cycle which still remain could
be printed they would fill some twenty-five volumes
the size of this. Moreover, a very great proportion of this
literature, even if there were no manuscripts at all, could
during the last and the preceding centuries have been
recovered from the lips of what has been absurdly called
an <q>illiterate</q> peasantry in the Highlands and in the
Gaelic-speaking parts or Ireland. It cannot but interest
us to study the character of the literature which was
capable of exercising such a spell.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Contrasted with the Ultonian Cycle</hi>
</p>

<p>
Let us begin by saying that the reader will find himself
in an altogether different atmosphere from that in which
the heroes of the Ultonian Cycle live and move. Everything
speaks of a later epoch, when life was gentler and
softer, when men lived more in settlements and towns,
<pb n='254' id='page254'/>
when the Danaan Folk were more distinctly fairies and
less deities, when in literature the elements of wonder
and romance predominated, and the iron string of
heroism and self-sacrifice was more rarely sounded.
There is in the Ossianic literature a conscious delight in
wild nature, in scenery, in the song of birds, the music
of the chase through the woods, in mysterious and
romantic adventure, which speaks unmistakably of a
time when the free, open-air life <q>under the greenwood
tree</q> is looked back on and idealised, but no longer
habitually lived, by those who celebrate it. There is
also a significant change of <hi rend='italic'>locale</hi>. The Conorian tales
were the product of a literary movement having its
sources among the bleak hills or on the stern rock-bound
coasts of Ulster. In the Ossianic Cycle we find
ourselves in the Midlands or South of Ireland. Much
of the action takes place amid the soft witchery of the
Killarney landscape, and the difference between the two
regions is reflected in the ethical temper of the tales.
</p>

<p>
In the Ultonian Cycle it will have been noticed that
however extravagantly the supernatural element may be
employed, the final significance of almost every tale, the
end to which all the supernatural machinery is worked,
is something real and human, something that has to do
with the virtues or vices, the passions or the duties or
men and women. In the Ossianic Cycle, broadly speaking,
this is not so. The nobler vein of literature seems
to have been exhausted, and we have now beauty for
the sake of beauty, romance for the sake of romance,
horror or mystery for the sake of the excitement they
arouse. The Ossianic tales are, at their best,
</p>

<p>
<q rend='display'>
<q>Lovely apparitions, sent
To be a moment's ornament.</q>
</q>
</p>

<p>
They lack that something, found in the noblest art as in
<pb n='255' id='page255'/>
the noblest personalities, which has power <q>to warn,
to comfort, and command.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Coming of Finn</hi>
</p>

<p>
King Cormac mac Art was certainly a historical
character, which is more, perhaps, than we can say of
Conor mac Nessa. Whether there is any real personage
behind the glorious figure of his great captain, Finn, it
is more difficult to say. But for our purpose it is not
necessary to go into this question. He was a creation
of the Celtic mind in one land and in one stage of its
development, and our part here is to show what kind
of character the Irish mind liked to idealise and make
stories about.
</p>

<p>
Finn, like most of the Irish heroes, had a partly
Danaan ancestry. His mother, Murna of the White
Neck, was grand-daughter of Nuada of the Silver Hand,
who had wedded that Ethlinn, daughter of Balor the
Fomorian, who bore the Sun-god Lugh to Kian.
Cumhal son of Trenmōr was Finn's father. He was
chief of the Clan Bascna, who were contending with the
Clan Morna for the leadership of the Fianna, and was
overthrown and slain by these at the battle of Knock.<note place='foot'><p>
Now Castleknock, near Dublin.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Among the Clan Morna was a man named Lia, the
lord of Luachar in Connacht, who was Treasurer of the
Fianna, and who kept the Treasure Bag, a bag made of
crane's skin and having in it magic weapons and jewels
of great price that had come down from the days of the
Danaans. And he became Treasurer to the Clan Morna
and still kept the bag at Rath Luachar.
</p>

<p>
Murna, after the defeat and death of Cumhal, took
refuge in the forests of Slieve Bloom,<note place='foot'><p>
In the King's County.
</p></note> and there she
bore a man-child whom she named Demna. For fear
<pb n='256' id='page256'/>
that the Clan Morna would find him out and slay him,
she gave him to be nurtured in the wildwood by two
aged women, and she herself became wife to the King
of Kerry. But Demna, when he grew up to be a lad,
was called <q>Finn,</q> or the Fair One, on account of the
whiteness of his skin and his golden hair, and by this
name he was always known thereafter. His first deed
was to slay Lia, who had the Treasure Bag of the Fianna,
which he took from him. He then sought out his
uncle Crimmal, who, with a few other old men, survivors
of the chiefs of Clan Bascna, had escaped the sword at
Castleknock, and were living in much penury and
affliction in the recesses of the forests of Connacht.
These he furnished with a retinue and guard from
among a body of youths who followed his fortunes, and
gave them the Treasure Bag. He himself went to
learn the accomplishments of poetry and science from
an ancient sage and Druid named Finegas, who dwelt
on the river Boyne. Here, in a pool of this river,
under boughs of hazel from which dropped the Nuts of
Knowledge on the stream, lived Fintan the Salmon of
Knowledge, which whoso ate of him would enjoy all
the wisdom of the ages. Finegas had sought many a
time to catch this salmon, but failed until Finn had
come to be his pupil. Then one day he caught it, and
gave it to Finn to cook, bidding him eat none of it himself,
but to tell him when it was ready. When the lad
brought the salmon, Finegas saw that his countenance
was changed. <q>Hast thou eaten of the salmon?</q> he
asked. <q>Nay,</q> said Finn, <q>but when I turned it on the
spit my thumb was burnt, and I put it to my mouth.</q>
<q>Take the Salmon of Knowledge and eat it,</q> then said
Finegas, <q>for in thee the prophecy is come true. And
now go hence, for I can teach thee no more.</q>
</p>

<p>
After that Finn became as wise as he was strong and
<pb n='257' id='page257'/>
bold, and it is said that whenever he wished to divine
what would befall, or what was happening at a distance,
he had but to put his thumb in his mouth and bite it,
and the knowledge he wished for would be his.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Finn and the Goblin</hi>
</p>

<p>
At this time Goll son of Morna was the captain of
the Fianna of Erin, but Finn, being come to man's
estate, wished to take the place of his father Cumhal.
So he went to Tara, and during the Great Assembly,
when no man might raise his hand against any other in
the precincts of Tara, he sat down among the king's
warriors and the Fianna. At last the king marked
him as a stranger among them, and bade him declare
his name and lineage. <q>I am Finn son of Cumhal,</q>
said he, <q>and I am come to take service with thee,
O King, as my father did.</q> The king accepted him
gladly, and Finn swore loyal service to him. No long
time after that came the period of the year when Tara
was troubled by a goblin or demon that came at nightfall
and blew fire-balls against the royal city, setting it
in flames, and none could do battle with him, for as he
came he played on a harp a music so sweet that each
man who heard it was lapped in dreams, and forgot all
else on earth for the sake of listening to that music.
When this was told to Finn he went to the king and
said: <q>Shall I, if I slay the goblin, have my father's
place as captain of the Fianna?</q> <q>Yea, surely,</q> said
the king, and he bound himself to this by an oath.
</p>

<p>
Now there were among the men-at-arms an old
follower of Finn's father, Cumhal, who possessed a
magic spear with a head of bronze and rivets of
Arabian gold. The head was kept laced up in a
leathern case; and it had the property that when the
naked blade was laid against the forehead of a man it
<pb n='258' id='page258'/>
would fill him with a strength and a battle-fury that
would make him invincible in every combat. This
spear the man Fiacha gave to Finn, and taught him
how to use it, and with it he awaited the coming of the
goblin on the ramparts of Tara. As night fell and
mists began to gather in the wide plain around the
Hill he saw a shadowy form coming swiftly towards
him, and heard the notes of the magic harp. But
laying the spear to his brow he shook off the spell, and
the phantom fled before him to the Fairy Mound of
Slieve Fuad, and there Finn overtook and slew him,
and bore back his head to Tara.
</p>

<p>
Then Cormac the King set Finn before the Fianna,
and bade them all either swear obedience to him as
their captain or seek service elsewhere. And first of all
Goll mac Morna swore service, and then all the rest
followed, and Finn became Captain of the Fianna of
Erin, and ruled them till he died.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Finn's Chief Men: Conan mac Lia</hi>
</p>

<p>
With the coming of Finn the Fianna of Erin came to
their glory, and with his life their glory passed away.
For he ruled them as no other captain ever did, both
strongly and wisely, and never bore a grudge against
any, but freely forgave a man all offences save disloyalty
to his lord. Thus it is told that Conan, son of the
lord of Luachar, him who had the Treasure Bag and
whom Finn slew at Rath Luachar, was for seven years
an outlaw and marauder, harrying the Fians and killing
here a man and there a hound, and firing dwellings, and
raiding their cattle. At last they ran him to a corner at
Carn Lewy, in Munster, and when he saw that he could
escape no more he stole upon Finn as he sat down after
a chase, and flung his arms round him from behind,
holding him fast and motionless. Finn knew who held
<pb n='259' id='page259'/>
him thus, and said: <q>What wilt thou, Conan?</q> Conan
said: <q>To make a covenant of service and fealty with
thee, for I may no longer evade thy wrath.</q> So Finn
laughed and said: <q>Be it so, Conan, and if thou prove
faithful and valiant I also will keep faith.</q> Conan
served him for thirty years, and no man of all the
Fianna was keener and hardier in fight.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Conan mac Morna</hi>
</p>

<p>
There was also another Conan, namely, mac Morna,
who was big and bald, and unwieldy in manly exercises,
but whose tongue was bitter and scurrilous; no high or
brave thing was done that Conan the Bald did not
mock and belittle. It is said that when he was stripped
he showed down his back and buttocks a black sheep's
fleece instead of a man's skin, and this is the way it
came about. One day when Conan and certain others
of the Fianna were hunting in the forest they came to
a stately dūn, white-walled, with coloured thatching on
the roof, and they entered it to seek hospitality. But
when they were within they found no man, but a
great empty hall with pillars of cedar-wood and silken
hangings about it, like the hall of a wealthy lord. In
the midst there was a table set forth with a sumptuous
feast of boar's flesh and venison, and a great vat of yew-wood
full of red wine, and cups of gold and silver. So
they set themselves gaily to eat and drink, for they
were hungry from the chase, and talk and laughter
were loud around the board. But one of them ere long
started to his feet with a cry of fear and wonder, and
they all looked round, and saw before their eyes the
tapestried walls changing to rough wooden beams, and
the ceiling to foul sooty thatch like that of a herdsman's
hut. So they knew they were being entrapped by some
enchantment of the Fairy Folk, and all sprang to their
<pb n='260' id='page260'/>
feet and made for the doorway, that was no longer
high and stately, but was shrinking to the size of a fox
earth&mdash;all but Conan the Bald, who was gluttonously
devouring the good things on the table, and heeded
nothing else. Then they shouted to him, and as the
last of them went out he strove to rise and follow, but
found himself limed to the chair so that he could not
stir. So two of the Fianna, seeing his plight, rushed
back and seized his arms and tugged with all their
might, and as they dragged him away they left the
most part of his raiment and his skin sticking to the
chair. Then, not knowing what else to do with him
in his sore plight, they clapped upon his back the nearest
thing they could find, which was the skin of a black sheep
that they took from a peasant's flock hard by, and it
grew there, and Conan wore it till his death.
</p>

<p>
Though Conan was a coward and rarely adventured
himself in battle with the Fianna, it is told that once a
good man fell by his hand. This was on the day of
the great battle with the pirate horde on the Hill of
Slaughter in Kerry.<note place='foot'><p>
The hill still bears the name, Knockanar.
</p></note> For Liagan, one of the invaders,
stood out before the hosts and challenged the bravest
of the Fians to single combat, and the Fians in mockery
thrust Conan forth to the fight. When he appeared
Liagan laughed, for he had more strength than wit, and
he said: <q>Silly is thy visit, thou bald old man.</q> And
as Conan still approached Liagan lifted his hand
fiercely, and Conan said: <q>Truly thou art in more
peril from the man behind than from the man in
front.</q> Liagan looked round; and in that instant
Conan swept off his head, and then threw his sword
and ran for shelter to the ranks of the laughing
Fians. But Finn was very wroth because he had won
the victory by a trick.
</p>


<pb n='261' id='page261'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Dermot O'Dyna</hi>
</p>

<p>
And one of the chiefest of the friends of Finn was
Dermot of the Love Spot. He was so fair and noble
to look on that no woman could refuse him love, and
it was said that he never knew weariness, but his step
was as light at the end of the longest day of battle or
the chase as it was at the beginning. Between him
and Finn there was great love, until the day when
Finn, then an old man, was to wed Grania, daughter
of Cormac the High King; but Grania bound Dermot
by the sacred ordinances of the Fian chivalry to fly
with her on her wedding night, which thing, sorely
against his will, he did, and thereby got his death.
But Grania went back to Finn, and when the Fianna
saw her they laughed through all the camp in bitter
mockery, for they would not have given one of the
dead man's fingers for twenty such as Grania.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Keelta mac Ronan and Oisīn</hi>
</p>

<p>
Another of the chief men that Finn had was Keelta
mac Ronan, who was one of his house-stewards, and
a strong warrior as well as a golden-tongued reciter
of tales and poems. And there was Oisīn, the son
of Finn, the greatest poet of the Gael, of whom more
shall be told hereafter.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Oscar</hi>
</p>

<p>
Oisīn had a son, Oscar, who was the fiercest fighter
in battle among all the Fians. He slew in his maiden
battle three kings, and in his fury he also slew by
mischance his own friend and condisciple Linné. His
wife was the fair Aideen, who died of grief after Oscar's
death in the battle of Gowra, and Oisīn buried her on
Ben Edar (Howth), and raised over her the great
<pb n='262' id='page262'/>
dolmen which is there to this day. Oscar appears in
this literature as a type of hard strength, with a heart
<q>like twisted horn sheathed in steel,</q> a character made
as purely for war as a sword or spear.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Geena mac Luga</hi>
</p>

<p>
Another good man that Finn had was Geena, the son
of Luga; his mother was the warrior-daughter of Finn,
and his father was a near kinsman of hers. He was
nurtured by a woman that bore the name of Fair Mane,
who had brought up many of the Fianna to manhood.
When his time to take arms was come he stood before
Finn and made his covenant of fealty, and Finn gave
him the captaincy of a band. But mac Luga proved
slothful and selfish, for ever vaunting himself and his
weapon-skill, and never training his men to the chase
of deer or boar, and he used to beat his hounds and his
serving-men. At last the Fians under him came with
their whole company to Finn at Loch Lena, in Killarney,
and there they laid their complaint against mac Luga,
and said: <q>Choose now, O Finn, whether you will have
us or the son of Luga by himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Finn sent to mac Luga and questioned him,
but mac Luga could say nothing to the point as to
why the Fianna would none of him. Then Finn
taught him the things befitting a youth of noble birth
and a captain of men, and they were these:
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Maxims of the Fianna</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>Son of Luga, if armed service be thy design, in a
great man's household be quiet, be surly in the narrow pass.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>Without a fault of his beat not thy hound; until
thou ascertain her guilt, bring not a charge against thy wife.</q>
</p>


<pb n='263' id='page263'/>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>In battle meddle not with a buffoon, for, O mac
Luga, he is but a fool.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>Censure not any if he be of grave repute; stand
not up to take part in a brawl; have naught to do with
a madman or a wicked one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>Two-thirds of thy gentleness be shown to women
and to those that creep on the floor (little children)
and to poets, and be not violent to the common people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>Utter not swaggering speech, nor say thou wilt
not yield what is right; it is a shameful thing to speak
too stiffly unless that it be feasible to carry out thy words.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>So long as thou shalt live, thy lord forsake not;
neither for gold nor for other reward in the world
abandon one whom thou art pledged to protect.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>To a chief do not abuse his people, for that is no
work for a man of gentle blood.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>Be no tale-bearer, nor utterer of falsehoods; be
not talkative nor rashly censorious. Stir not up strife
against thee, however good a man thou be.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>Be no frequenter of the drinking-house, nor given
to carping at the old; meddle not with a man of mean estate.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>Dispense thy meat freely; have no niggard for
thy familiar.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>Force not thyself upon a chief, nor give him cause
to speak ill of thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='post: none'>Stick to thy gear; hold fast to thy arms till the
stern fight with its weapon-glitter be ended.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be more apt to give than to deny, and follow after
gentleness, O son of Luga.</q>
</p>

<p>
And the son of Luga, it is written, heeded these
counsels, and gave up his bad ways, and he became one
of the best of Finn's men.
</p>


<pb n='264' id='page264'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Character of Finn</hi>
</p>

<p>
Suchlike things also Finn taught to all his followers,
and the best of them became like himself in valour and
gentleness and generosity. Each of them loved the
repute of his comrades more than his own, and each
would say that for all noble qualities there was no man
in the breadth of the world worthy to be thought of
beside Finn.
</p>

<p>
It was said of him that <q>he gave away gold as if it
were the leaves of the woodland, and silver as if it
were the foam of the sea</q>; and that whatever he had
bestowed upon any man, if he fell out with him afterwards,
he was never known to bring it against him.
</p>

<p>
The poet Oisīn once sang of him to St. Patrick:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>These are the things that were dear to Finn&mdash;</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 3'>The din of battle, the banquet's glee,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>The bay of his hounds through the rough glen ringing,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 3'>And the blackbird singing in Letter Lee,</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>The shingle grinding along the shore</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 3'>When they dragged his war-boats down to sea,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>The dawn wind whistling his spears among,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 3'><q rend='pre: none'>And the magic song of his minstrels three.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Tests of the Fianna</hi>
</p>

<p>
In the time of Finn no one was ever permitted to be
one of the Fianna of Erin unless he could pass through
many severe tests of his worthiness. He must be versed
in the Twelve Books of Poetry, and must himself be
skilled to make verse in the rime and metre of the
masters of Gaelic poesy. Then he was buried to his
middle in the earth, and must, with a shield and a
hazel stick, there defend himself against nine warriors
casting spears at him, and if he were wounded he was
not accepted. Then his hair was woven into braids,
and he was chased through the forest by the Fians. If
<pb n='265' id='page265'/>
he were overtaken, or if a braid of his hair were
disturbed, or if a dry stick cracked under his foot, he
was not accepted. He must be able to leap over a lath
level with his brow, and to run at full speed under one
level with his knee, and he must be able while running
to draw out a thorn from his foot and never slacken

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Keelta and St. Patrick</hi>
</p>

<p>
It was said that one of the Fians, namely, Keelta,
lived on to a great age, and saw St. Patrick, by whom
he was baptized into the faith of the Christ, and to
whom he told many tales of Finn and his men, which
Patrick's scribe wrote down. And once Patrick asked
him how it was that the Fianna became so mighty and
so glorious that all Ireland sang of their deeds, as
Ireland has done ever since. Keelta answered: <q>Truth
was in our hearts and strength in our arms, and what
we said, that we fulfilled.</q>
</p>

<p>
This was also told of Keelta after he had seen St.
Patrick and received the Faith. He chanced to be one
day by Leyney, in Connacht, where the Fairy Folk of
the Mound of Duma were wont to be sorely harassed
and spoiled every year by pirates from oversea. They
called Keelta to their aid, and by his counsel and valour
the invaders were overcome and driven home; but
Keelta was sorely wounded. Then Keelta asked that
Owen, the seer of the Fairy Folk, might foretell him
how long he had to live, for he was already a very aged
man. Owen said: <q>It will be seventeen years, O
Keelta of fair fame, till thou fall by the pool of Tara,
and grievous that will be to all the king's household.</q>
<q>Even so did my chief and lord, my guardian and
loving protector, Finn, foretell to me,</q> said Keelta.
<q>And now what fee will ye give me for my rescue
<pb n='266' id='page266'/>
of you from the worst affliction that ever befell you?</q>
<q>A great reward,</q> said the Fairy Folk, <q>even youth;
for by our art we shall change you into a young man
again with all the strength and activity of your prime.</q>
<q>Nay, God forbid,</q> said Keelta, <q>that I should take
upon me a shape of sorcery, or any other than that
which my Maker, the true and glorious God, hath
bestowed upon me.</q> And the Fairy Folk said: <q>It
is the word of a true warrior and hero, and the thing
that thou sayest is good.</q> So they healed his wounds,
and every bodily evil that he had, and he wished them
blessing and victory, and went his way.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Birth of Oisīn</hi>
</p>

<p>
One day, as Finn and his companions and dogs were
returning from the chase to their dūn on the Hill of
Allen, a beautiful fawn started up on their path, and the
chase swept after her, she taking the way which led to
their home. Soon all the pursuers were left far behind
save only Finn himself and his two hounds Bran and
Skolawn. Now these hounds were of strange breed;
for Tyren, sister to Murna, the mother of Finn, had
been changed into a hound by the enchantment of a
woman of the Fairy Folk, who loved Tyren's husband
Ullan; and the two hounds of Finn were the children
of Tyren, born to her in that shape. Of all hounds in
Ireland they were the best, and Finn loved them much,
so that it was said he wept but twice in his life, and
once was for the death of Bran.
</p>

<p>
At last, as the chase went on down a valley-side,
Finn saw the fawn stop and lie down, while the two
hounds began to play round her, and to lick her face
and limbs. So he gave commandment that none should
hurt her, and she followed them to the Dūn of Allen,
playing with the hounds as she went.
</p>


<pb n='267' id='page267'/>

<p>
The same night Finn awoke and saw standing by
his bed the fairest woman his eyes had ever beheld.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am Saba, O Finn,</q> she said, <q>and I was the
fawn ye chased to-day. Because I would not give
my love to the Druid of the Fairy Folk, who is named
the Dark, he put that shape upon me by his sorceries,
and I have borne it these three years. But a slave of
his, pitying me, once revealed to me that if I could win
to thy great Dūn of Allen, O Finn, I should be safe
from all enchantments, and my natural shape would
come to me again. But I feared to be torn in pieces
by thy dogs, or wounded by thy hunters, till at last I
let myself be overtaken by thee alone and by Bran and
Skolawn, who have the nature of man and would do
me no hurt.</q> <q>Have no fear, maiden,</q> said Finn;
<q>we, the Fianna, are free, and our guest-friends are
free; there is none who shall put compulsion on you here.</q>
</p>

<p>
So Saba dwelt with Finn, and he made her his wife;
and so deep was his love for her that neither the battle
nor the chase had any delight for him, and for months
he never left her side. She also loved him as deeply,
and their joy in each other was like that of the
Immortals in the Land of Youth. But at last word
came to Finn that the warships of the Northmen were
in the Bay of Dublin, and he summoned his heroes to
the fight; <q>For,</q> said he to Saba, <q>the men of Erin
give us tribute and hospitality to defend them from the
foreigner, and it were shame to take it from them and
not to give that to which we, on our side, are pledged.</q>
And he called to mind that great saying of Goll mac
Morna when they were once sore bestead by a mighty
host. <q>A man,</q> said Goll, <q>lives after his life, but
not after his honour.</q>
</p>

<p>
Seven days was Finn absent, and he drove the Northmen
<pb n='268' id='page268'/>
from the shores of Erin. But on the eighth day
he returned, and when he entered his dūn he saw
trouble in the eyes of his men, and of their fair womenfolk,
and Saba was not on the rampart expecting his
return. So he bade them tell him what had chanced,
and they said:
</p>

<p>
<q>Whilst thou, our father and lord, wert afar off
smiting the foreigner, and Saba looking ever down the
pass for thy return, we saw one day as it were the likeness
of thee approaching, and Bran and Skolawn at thy
heels. And we seemed also to hear the notes of the
Fian hunting-call blown on the wind. Then Saba
hastened to the great gate, and we could not stay her, so
eager was she to rush to the phantom. But when she
came near she halted and gave a loud and bitter cry,
and the shape of thee smote her with a hazel wand, and
lo, there was no woman there any more, but a deer.
Then those hounds chased it, and ever as it strove to
reach again the gate of the dūn they turned back. We
all now seized what arms we could and ran out to drive
away the enchanter, but when we reached the place there
was nothing to be seen, only still we heard the rushing
of flying feet and the baying of dogs, and one thought
it came from here, and another from there, till at last
the uproar died away and all was still. What we could
do, O Finn, we did; Saba is gone.</q>
</p>

<p>
Finn then struck his hand on his breast, but spoke no
word, and he went to his own chamber. No man saw
him for the rest of that day, nor for the day after. Then
he came forth, and ordered the matters of the Fianna as
of old, but for seven years thereafter he went searching
for Saba through every remote glen and dark forest and
cavern of Ireland, and he would take no hounds with him
save Bran and Skolawn. But at last he renounced all
hope of finding her again, and went hunting as of old.
</p>


<pb n='269' id='page269'/>

<p>
One day as he was following the chase on Ben Bulban,
in Sligo, he heard the musical bay of the dogs change of
a sudden to a fierce growling and yelping, as though they
were in combat with some beast, and running hastily up
he and his men beheld, under a great tree, a naked boy
with long hair, and around him the hounds struggling
to seize him, but Bran and Skolawn fighting with them
and keeping them off. And the lad was tall and shapely,
and as the heroes gathered round he gazed undauntedly
on them, never heeding the rout of dogs at his feet.
The Fians beat off the dogs and brought the lad home
with them, and Finn was very silent and continually
searched the lad's countenance with his eyes. In time
the use of speech came to him, and the story that he told
was this:
</p>

<p>
He had known no father, and no mother save a gentle
hind, with whom he lived in a most green and pleasant
valley shut in on every side by towering cliffs that could
not be scaled or by deep chasms in the earth. In the
summer he lived on fruits and suchlike, and in the
winter store of provisions was laid for him in a cave.
And there came to them sometimes a tall, dark-visaged
man, who spoke to his mother, now tenderly, and now
in loud menace, but she always shrank away in fear, and
the man departed in anger. At last there came a day
when the dark man spoke very long with his mother in
all tones of entreaty and of tenderness and of rage, but
she would still keep aloof and give no sign save of fear
and abhorrence. Then at length the dark man drew
near and smote her with a hazel wand; and with that
he turned and went his way, but she this time followed
him, still looking back at her son and piteously complaining.
And he, when he strove to follow, found himself
unable to move a limb; and crying out with rage
and desolation he fell to the earth, and his senses left him.
</p>


<pb n='270' id='page270'/>

<p>
When he came to himself he was on the mountain-side
on Ben Bulban, where he remained some days, searching
for that green and hidden valley, which he never found
again. And after a while the dogs found him; but of
the hind his mother and of the Dark Druid there is no
man knows the end.
</p>

<p>
Finn called his name Oisīn (Little Fawn), and he
became a warrior of fame, but far more famous for the
songs and tales that he made; so that of all things to
this day that are told of the Fianna of Erin men are
wont to say: <q>Thus sang the bard Oisīn, son of Finn.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Oisīn and Niam</hi>
</p>

<p>
It happened that on a misty summer morning as
Finn and Oisīn with many companions were hunting on
the shores of Loch Lena they saw coming towards them
a maiden, beautiful exceedingly, riding on a snow-white
steed. She wore the garb of a queen; a crown of gold
was on her head, and a dark-brown mantle of silk, set
with stars of red gold, fell around her and trailed on the
ground. Silver shoes were on her horse's hoofs, and a
crest of gold nodded on his head. When she came near
she said to Finn: <q>From very far away I have come, and
now at last I have found thee, Finn son of Cumhal.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Finn said: <q>What is thy land and race, maiden,
and what dost thou seek from me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My name,</q> she said, <q>is Niam of the Golden Hair.
I am the daughter of the King of the Land of Youth,
and that which has brought me here is the love of thy
son Oisīn.</q> Then she turned to Oisīn, and she spoke to
him in the voice of one who has never asked anything
but it was granted to her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wilt thou go with me, Oisīn, to my father's land?</q>
</p>

<p>
And Oisīn said: <q>That will I, and to the world's
end</q>; for the fairy spell had so wrought upon his
<pb n='271' id='page271'/>
heart that he cared no more for any earthly thing but
to have the love of Niam of the Head of Gold.
</p>

<p>
Then the maiden spoke of the Land Oversea to
which she had summoned her lover, and as she spoke a
dreamy stillness fell on all things, nor did a horse shake
his bit, nor a hound bay, nor the least breath of wind
stir in the forest trees till she had made an end. And
what she said seemed sweeter and more wonderful as she
spoke it than anything they could afterwards remember
to have heard, but so far as they could remember it it
was this:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Delightful is the land beyond all dreams,</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>Fairer than aught thine eyes have ever seen.</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>There all the year the fruit is on the tree,</l>

<l rend='margin-left: 1'><q rend='pre: none'>And lord of Niam of the Head of Gold.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
As the magic song ended the Fians beheld Oisīn
mount the fairy steed and hold the maiden in his
arms, and ere they could stir or speak she turned her
horse's head and shook the ringing bridle, and down
the forest glade they fled, as a beam of light flies over
<pb n='272' id='page272'/>
the land when clouds drive across the sun; and never
did the Fianna behold Oisīn son of Finn on earth
again.
</p>

<p>
Yet what befell him afterwards is known. As his
birth was strange, so was his end, for he saw the wonders
of the Land of Youth with mortal eyes and lived to tell
them with mortal lips.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Journey to Fairyland</hi>
</p>

<p>
When the white horse with its riders reached the sea
it ran lightly over the waves, and soon the green woods
and headlands of Erin faded out of sight. And now
the sun shone fiercely down, and the riders passed into
a golden haze in which Oisīn lost all knowledge of where
he was or if sea or dry land were beneath his horse's
hoofs. But strange sights sometimes appeared to them
in the mist, for towers and palace gateways loomed up
and disappeared, and once a hornless doe bounded by
them chased by a white hound with one red ear; and
again they saw a young maid ride by on a brown steed,
bearing a golden apple in her hand, and close behind
her followed a young horseman on a white steed, a
purple cloak floating at his back and a gold-hilted sword
in his hand. And Oisīn would have asked the princess
who and what these apparitions were, but Niam bade
him ask nothing nor seem to notice any phantom
they might see until they were come to the Land of
Youth.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Oisīn's Return</hi>
</p>

<p>
The story goes on to tell how Oisīn met with various
adventures in the Land of Youth, including the rescue of
an imprisoned princess from a Fomorian giant. But at
last, after what seemed to him a sojourn of three weeks
in the Land of Youth, he was satiated with delights of
<pb n='273' id='page273'/>
every kind, and longed to visit his native land again
and to see his old comrades. He promised to return
when he had done so, and Niam gave him the white
fairy steed that had borne him across the sea to Fairyland,
but charged him that when he had reached the
Land of Erin again he must never alight from its back
nor touch the soil of the earthly world with his foot,
or the way of return to the Land of Youth would be
barred to him for ever. Oisīn then set forth, and once
more crossed the mystic ocean, finding himself at last on
the western shores of Ireland. Here he made at once
for the Hill of Allen, where the dūn of Finn was wont
to be, but marvelled, as he traversed the woods, that he
met no sign of the Fian hunters and at the small size
of the folk whom he saw tilling the ground.
</p>

<p>
At length, coming from the forest path into the great
clearing where the Hill of Allen was wont to rise, broad
and green, with its rampart enclosing many white-walled
dwellings, and the great hall towering high in the midst,
he saw but grassy mounds overgrown with rank weeds
and whin bushes, and among them pastured a peasant's
kine. Then a strange horror fell upon him and he
thought some enchantment from the land of Faëry held
his eyes and mocked him with false visions. He threw
his arms abroad and shouted the names of Finn and
Oscar, but none replied, and he thought that perchance
the hounds might hear him, so he cried upon Bran and
Skolawn and strained his ears if they might catch the
faintest rustle or whisper of the world from the sight
of which his eyes were holden, but he heard only the
sighing of the wind in the whins. Then he rode in terror
from that place, setting his face towards the eastern
sea, for he meant to traverse Ireland from side to side
and end to end in search of some escape from his
enchantment.
</p>

<pb n='274' id='page274'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Broken Spell</hi>
</p>

<p>
But when he came near to the eastern sea, and was
now in the place which is called the Valley of the
Thrushes,<note place='foot'><p>
Glanismole, near Dublin.
</p></note> he saw in a field upon the hillside a crowd
of men striving to roll aside a great boulder from their
tilled land, and an overseer directing them. Towards
them he rode, meaning to ask them concerning Finn
and the Fianna. As he came near they all stopped
their work to gaze upon him, for to them he appeared
like a messenger of the Fairy Folk or an angel from
heaven. Taller and mightier he was than the men-folk
they knew, with sword-blue eyes and brown, ruddy
cheeks; in his mouth, as it were, a shower of pearls,
and bright hair clustered beneath the rim of his helmet.
And as Oisīn looked upon their puny forms, marred by
toil and care, and at the stone which they feebly strove
to heave from its bed, he was filled with pity, and thought
to himself, <q>Not such were even the churls of Erin when
I left them for the Land of Youth</q> and he stooped
from his saddle to help them. He set his hand to the
boulder, and with a mighty heave he lifted it from
where it lay and set it rolling down the hill. And the
men raised a shout of wonder and applause; but their
shouting changed in a moment into cries of terror and
dismay, and they fled, jostling and overthrowing each
other to escape from the place of fear, for a marvel
horrible to see had taken place. For Oisīn's saddle-girth
had burst as he heaved the stone and he fell
headlong to the ground. In an instant the white steed
had vanished from their eyes like a wreath of mist, and
that which rose, feeble and staggering, from the ground
was no youthful warrior, but a man stricken with extreme
old age, white-bearded and withered, who stretched out
<pb n='275' id='page275'/>
groping hands and moaned with feeble and bitter cries.
And his crimson cloak and yellow silken tunic were
now but coarse homespun stuff tied with a hempen
girdle, and the gold-hilted sword was a rough oaken
staff such as a beggar carries who wanders the roads
from farmer's house to house.
</p>

<p>
When the people saw that the doom that had been
wrought was not for them they returned, and found the
old man prone on the ground with his face hidden in his
arms. So they lifted him up, and asked who he was
and what had befallen him. Oisīn gazed round on them
with dim eyes, and at last he said: <q>I was Oisīn the son
of Finn, and I pray ye tell me where he dwells, for
his dūn on the Hill of Allen is now a desolation, and I
have neither seen him nor heard his hunting-horn from
the western to the eastern sea.</q> Then the men gazed
strangely on each other and on Oisīn, and the overseer
asked: <q>Of what Finn dost thou speak, for there be
many of that name in Erin?</q> Oisīn said: <q>Surely of
Finn mac Cumhal mac Trenmōr, captain of the Fianna
of Erin.</q> Then the overseer said: <q>Thou art daft, old
man, and thou hast made us daft to take thee for a youth
as we did a while agone. But we at least have now our
wits again, and we know that Finn son of Cumhal and
all his generation have been dead these three hundred
years. At the battle of Gowra fell Oscar, son of Oisīn,
and Finn at the battle of Brea, as the historians tell us;
and the lays of Oisīn, whose death no man knows the
manner of, are sung by our harpers at great men's feasts.
But now the Talkenn,<note place='foot'><p>
Talkenn, or <q>Adze-head,</q> was a name given to St. Patrick by
the Irish. Probably it referred to the shape of his tonsure.
</p></note> Patrick, has come into Ireland,
and has preached to us the One God and Christ His
Son, by whose might these old days and ways are done
away with; and Finn and his Fianna, with their feasting
<pb n='276' id='page276'/>
and hunting and songs of war and of love, have no such
reverence among us as the monks and virgins of Holy
Patrick, and the psalms and prayers that go up daily to
cleanse us from sin and to save us from the fire of judgment.</q>
But Oisīn replied, only half hearing and still less
comprehending what was said to him: <q>If thy God have
slain Finn and Oscar, I would say that God is a strong
man.</q> Then they all cried out upon him, and some
picked up stones, but the overseer bade them let him be
until the Talkenn had spoken with him, and till he should
order what was to be done.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Oisīn and Patrick</hi>
</p>

<p>
So they brought him to Patrick, who treated him
gently and hospitably, and to Patrick he told the story
of all that had befallen him. But Patrick bade his scribes
write all carefully down, that the memory of the heroes
whom Oisīn had known, and of the joyous and free life
they had led in the woods and glens and wild places of
Erin, should never be forgotten among men.
</p>

<p>
This remarkable legend is known only in the modern
Irish poem written by Michael Comyn about 1750, a
poem which may be called the swan-song of Irish literature.
Doubtless Comyn worked on earlier traditional
material; but though the ancient Ossianic poems tell us
of the prolongation of Oisīn's life, so that he could meet
St. Patrick and tell him stories of the Fianna, the
episodes of Niam's courtship and the sojourn in the
Land of Youth are known to us at present only in
the poem of Michael Comyn.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Enchanted Cave</hi>
</p>

<p>
This tale, which I take from S.H. O'Grady's edition
in <q>Silva Gadelica,</q> relates that Finn once made a great
hunting in the district of Corann, in Northern Connacht,
<pb n='277' id='page277'/>
which was ruled over by one Conaran, a lord of the
Danaan Folk. Angered at the intrusion of the Fianna in
his hunting-grounds, he sent his three sorcerer-daughters
to take vengeance on the mortals.
</p>

<p>
Finn, it is said, and Conan the Bald, with Finn's two
favourite hounds, were watching the hunt from the top
of the Hill of Keshcorran and listening to the cries of
the beaters and the notes of the horn and the baying of
the dogs, when, in moving about on the hill, they came
upon the mouth of a great cavern, before which sat three
hags of evil and revolting aspect. On three crooked
sticks of holly they had twisted left-handwise hanks of
yarn, and were spinning with these when Finn and his
followers arrived. To view them more closely the
warriors drew near, when they found themselves suddenly
entangled in strands of the yarn which the hags
had spun about the place like the web of a spider, and
deadly faintness and trembling came over them, so that
they were easily bound fast by the hags and carried into
the dark recesses of the cave. Others of the party then
arrived, looking for Finn. All suffered the same experience&mdash;they
lost all their pith and valour at the touch of
the bewitched yarn, and were bound and carried into the
cave, until the whole party were laid in bonds, with the
dogs baying and howling outside.
</p>

<p>
The witches now seized their sharp, wide-channelled,
hard-tempered swords, and were about to fall on the
captives and slay them, but first they looked round at
the mouth of the cave to see if there was any straggler
whom they had not yet laid hold of. At this moment
Goll mac Morna, <q>the raging lion, the torch of onset,
the great of soul,</q> came up, and a desperate combat
ensued, which ended by Goll cleaving two of the hags
in twain, and then subduing and binding the third,
whose name was Irnan. She, as he was about to slay
<pb n='278' id='page278'/>
her, begged for mercy&mdash;<q>Surely it were better for thee
to have the Fianna whole</q>&mdash;and he gave her her life if
she would release the prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Into the cave they went, and one by one the captives
were unbound, beginning with the poet Fergus Truelips
and the <q>men of science,</q> and they all sat down
on the hill to recover themselves, while Fergus sang a
chant of praise in honour of the rescuer, Goll; and
Irnan disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Ere long a monster was seen approaching them, a
<q>gnarled hag</q> with blazing, bloodshot eyes, a yawning
mouth full of ragged fangs, nails like a wild beast's, and
armed like a warrior. She laid Finn under <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> to
provide her with single combat from among his men
until she should have her fill of it. It was no other than
the third sister, Irnan, whom Goll had spared. Finn
in vain begged Oisīn, Oscar, Keelta, and the other prime
warriors of the Fianna to meet her; they all pleaded
inability after the ill-treatment and contumely they had
received. At last, as Finn himself was about to do battle
with her, Goll said: <q>O Finn, combat with a crone
beseems thee not,</q> and he drew sword for a second
battle with this horrible enemy. At last, after a desperate
combat, he ran her through her shield and through her
heart, so that the blade stuck out at the far side, and she
fell dead. The Fianna then sacked the dūn of Conaran,
and took possession of all the treasure in it, while
Finn bestowed on Goll mac Morna his own daughter,
Keva of the White Skin, and, leaving the dūn a heap of
glowing embers, they returned to the Hill of Allen.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Chase of Slievegallion</hi>
</p>

<p>
This fine story, which is given in poetical form, as if
narrated by Oisīn, in the Ossianic Society's <q>Transactions,</q>
tells how Cullan the Smith (here represented as
<pb n='279' id='page279'/>
a Danaan divinity), who dwelt on or near the mountains
of Slievegallion, in Co. Armagh, had two daughters,
Ainé and Milucra, each of whom loved Finn mac
Cumhal. They were jealous of each other; and on
Ainé once happening to say that she would never have
a man with grey hair, Milucra saw a means of securing
Finn's love entirely for herself. So she assembled her
friends among the Danaans round the little grey lake
that lies on the top of Slievegallion, and they charged
its waters with enchantments.
</p>

<p>
This introduction, it may be observed, bears strong
signs of being a later addition to the original tale, made
in a less understanding age or by a less thoughtful class
into whose hands the legend had descended. The real
meaning of the transformation which it narrates is
probably much deeper.
</p>

<p>
The story goes on to say that not long after this the
hounds of Finn, Bran and Skolawn, started a fawn near
the Hill of Allen, and ran it northwards till the chase
ended on the top of Slievegallion, a mountain which,
like Slievenamon<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Sleeve-na-mon´</q>: accent on last syllable. It
means the Mountain of the [Fairy] Women.
</p></note> in the south, was in ancient Ireland
a veritable focus of Danaan magic and legendary lore.
Finn followed the hounds alone till the fawn disappeared
on the mountain-side. In searching for it Finn at last
came on the little lake which lies on the top of the
mountain, and saw by its brink a lady of wonderful
beauty, who sat there lamenting and weeping. Finn
asked her the cause of her grief. She explained that a
gold ring which she dearly prized had fallen from her
finger into the lake, and she charged Finn by the
bonds of <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> that he should plunge in and find it
for her.
</p>

<p>
Finn did so, and after diving into every recess of the
<pb n='280' id='page280'/>
lake he discovered the ring, and before leaving the
water gave it to the lady. She immediately plunged
into the lake and disappeared. Finn then surmised
that some enchantment was being wrought on him, and
ere long he knew what it was, for on stepping forth on
dry land he fell down from sheer weakness, and arose
again, a tottering and feeble old man, snowy-haired
and withered, so that even his faithful hounds did not
know him, but ran round the lake searching for their
lost master.
</p>

<p>
Meantime Finn was missed from his palace on the
Hill of Allen, and a party soon set out on the track on
which he had been seen to chase the deer. They came
to the lake-side on Slievegallion, and found there a
wretched and palsied old man, whom they questioned,
but who could do nothing but beat his breast and moan.
At last, beckoning Keelta to come near, the aged man
whispered faintly some words into his ear, and lo, it was
Finn himself! When the Fianna had ceased from
their cries of wonder and lamentation, Finn whispered
to Keelta the tale of his enchantment, and told them
that the author of it must be the daughter of Cullan
the Smith, who dwelt in the Fairy Mound of Slievegallion.
The Fianna, bearing Finn on a litter, immediately
went to the Mound and began to dig fiercely.
For three days and nights they dug at the Fairy Mound,
and at last penetrated to its inmost recesses, when a
maiden suddenly stood before them holding a drinking-horn
of red gold. It was given to Finn. He drank
from it, and at once his beauty and form were restored
to him, but his hair still remained white as silver. This
too would have been restored by another draught, but
Finn let it stay as it was, and silver-white his hair
remained to the day of his death.
</p>

<p>
The tale has been made the subject of a very striking
<pb n='281' id='page281'/>
allegorical drama, <q>The Masque of Finn,</q> by Mr.
Standish O'Grady, who, rightly no doubt, interprets
the story as symbolising the acquisition of wisdom and
understanding through suffering. A leader of men
must descend into the lake of tears and know feebleness
and despair before his spirit can sway them to
great ends.
</p>

<p>
There is an antique sepulchral monument on the
mountain-top which the peasantry of the district still
regard&mdash;or did in the days before Board schools&mdash;as
the abode of the <q>Witch of the Lake</q>; and a mysterious
beaten path, which was never worn by the passage
of human feet, and which leads from the rock sepulchre
to the lake-side, is ascribed to the going to and fro of
this supernatural being.

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The <q>Colloquy of the Ancients</q></hi>
</p>

<p>
One of the most interesting and attractive of the
relics of Ossianic literature is the <q>Colloquy of the
Ancients,</q> <hi rend='italic'>Agallamh na Senorach</hi>, a long narrative piece
dating from about the thirteenth century. It has
been published with a translation in O'Grady's <q>Silva
Gadelica.</q> It is not so much a story as a collection
of stories skilfully set in a mythical framework. The
<q>Colloquy</q> opens by presenting us with the figures of
Keelta mac Ronan and Oisīn son of Finn, each accompanied
by eight warriors, all that are left of the great
fellowship of the Fianna after the battle of Gowra and
the subsequent dispersion of the Order. A vivid picture
is given us of the grey old warriors, who had outlived
their epoch, meeting for the last time at the dūn of a
once famous chieftainess named Camha, and of their
melancholy talk over bygone days, till at last a long
silence settled on them.
</p>

<pb n='282' id='page282'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Keelta Meets St. Patrick</hi>
</p>

<p>
Finally Keelta and Oisīn resolve to part, Oisīn, of
whom we hear little more, going to the Fairy Mound,
where his Danaan mother (here called Blai) has her
dwelling, while Keelta takes his way over the plains of
Meath till he comes to Drumderg, where he lights on
St. Patrick and his monks. How this is chronologically
possible the writer does not trouble himself to explain,
and he shows no knowledge of the legend of Oisīn in the
Land of Youth. <q>The clerics,</q> says the story, <q>saw
Keelta and his band draw near them, and fear fell on
them before the tall men with the huge wolf-hounds that
accompanied them, for they were not people of one
epoch or of one time with the clergy.</q> Patrick then
sprinkles the heroes with holy water, whereat legions
of demons who had been hovering over them fly away
into the hills and glens, and <q>the enormous men sat
down.</q> Patrick, after inquiring the name of his guest,
then says he has a boon to crave of him&mdash;he wishes to
find a well of pure water with which to baptize the folk
of Bregia and of Meath.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Well of Tradaban</hi>
</p>

<p>
Keelta, who knows every brook and hill and rath and
wood in the country, thereon takes Patrick by the hand
and leads him away <q>till,</q> as the writer says, <q>right in
front of them they saw a loch-well, sparkling and translucid.
The size and thickness of the cress and of the
<hi rend='italic'>fothlacht</hi>, or brooklime, that grew on it was a wonderment
to them.</q> Then Keelta began to tell of the fame
and qualities of the place, and uttered an exquisite little
lyric in praise of it:
</p>

<p>
<q>O Well of the Strand of the Two Women, beautiful
are thy cresses, luxuriant, branching; since thy produce
<pb n='283' id='page283'/>
is neglected on thee thy brooklime is not suffered to
grow. Forth from thy banks thy trout are to be seen,
thy wild swine in the wilderness; the deer of thy fair
hunting crag-land, thy dappled and red-chested fawns!
Thy mast all hanging on the branches of the trees; thy
fish in estuaries of the rivers; lovely the colours of thy
purling streams, O thou that art azure-hued, and again
green with reflections of surrounding copse-wood.</q><note place='foot'><p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>St. Patrick and Irish Legend</hi>
</p>

<p>
After the warriors have been entertained Patrick asks:
<q>Was he, Finn mac Cumhal, a good lord with whom
ye were?</q> Keelta praises the generosity of Finn, and
goes on to describe in detail the glories of his household,
whereon Patrick says:
</p>

<p>
<q>Were it not for us an impairing of the devout life,
an occasion of neglecting prayer, and of deserting converse
with God, we, as we talked with thee, would feel
the time pass quickly, warrior!</q>
</p>

<p>
Keelta goes on with another tale of the Fianna, and
Patrick, now fairly caught in the toils of the enchanter,
cries: <q>Success and benediction attend thee, Keelta!
This is to me a lightening of spirit and mind. And now
tell us another tale.</q>
</p>

<p>
So ends the exordium of the <q>Colloquy.</q> As usual
in the openings of Irish tales, nothing could be better
contrived; the touch is so light, there is so happy a
mingling of pathos, poetry, and humour, and so much
dignity in the sketching of the human characters introduced.
The rest of the piece consists in the exhibition
of a vast amount of topographical and legendary lore
by Keelta, attended by the invariable <q>Success and
benediction attend thee!</q> of Patrick.
</p>

<p>
They move together, the warrior and the saint, on
<pb n='284' id='page284'/>
Patrick's journey to Tara, and whenever Patrick or
some one else in the company sees a hill or a fort
or a well he asks Keelta what it is, and Keelta tells
its name and a Fian legend to account for it, and so the
story wanders on through a maze of legendary lore until
they are met by a company from Tara, with the king at
its head, who then takes up the <hi rend='italic'>rôle</hi> of questioner. The
<q>Colloquy,</q> as we have it now, breaks off abruptly as
the story how the <hi rend='italic'>Lia Fail</hi> was carried off from Ireland
is about to be narrated.<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page105'>p. 105</ref>.
</p></note> The interest of the <q>Colloquy</q>
lies in the tales of Keelta and the lyrics introduced in the
course of them. Of the tales there are about a hundred,
telling of Fian raids and battles, and love-makings and
feastings, but the greater number of them have to do
with the intercourse between the Fairy Folk and the
Fianna. With these folk the Fianna have constant
relations, both of love and of war. Some of the tales are
of great elaboration, wrought out in the highest style of
which the writer was capable. One of the best is that
of the fairy <hi rend='italic'>Brugh</hi>, or mansion of Slievenamon, which
Patrick and Keelta chance to pass by, and of which Keelta
tells the following history:
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Brugh of Slievenamon</hi>
</p>

<p>
One day as Finn and Keelta and five other champions
of the Fianna were hunting at Torach, in the north,
they roused a beautiful fawn which fled before them,
they holding it in chase all day, till they reached the
mountain of Slievenamon towards evening, when the
fawn suddenly seemed to vanish underground. A
chase like this, in the Ossianic literature, is the common
prelude to an adventure in Fairyland. Night now
fell rapidly, and with it came heavy snow and storm,
and, searching for shelter, the Fianna discovered in the
<pb n='285' id='page285'/>
wood a great illuminated <hi rend='italic'>Brugh</hi>, or mansion, where
they sought admittance. On entering they found
themselves in a spacious hall, full of light, with eight-and-twenty
warriors and as many fair and yellow-haired
maidens, one of the latter seated on a chair of
crystal, and making wonderful music on a harp. After
the Fian warriors have been entertained with the finest
of viands and liquors, it is explained to them that their
hosts are Donn, son of Midir the Proud, and his
brother, and that they are at war with the rest of the
Danaan Folk, and have to do battle with them thrice
yearly on the green before the <hi rend='italic'>Brugh</hi>. At first each of
the twenty-eight had a thousand warriors under him.
Now all are slain except those present, and the survivors
have sent out one of their maidens in the shape of a
fawn to entice the Fianna to their fairy palace and to
gain their aid in the battle that must be delivered
to-morrow. We have, in fact, a variant of the well-known
theme of the Rescue of Fairyland. Finn and
his companions are always ready for a fray, and a
desperate battle ensues which lasts from evening till
morning, for the fairy host attack at night. The
assailants are beaten off, losing over a thousand of
their number; but Oscar, Dermot, and mac Luga are
sorely wounded. They are healed by magical herbs;
and more fighting and other adventures follow, until,
after a year has passed, Finn compels the enemy to
make peace and give hostages, when the Fianna
return to earth and rejoin their fellows. No sooner
has Keelta finished his tale, standing on the very spot
where they had found the fairy palace on the night of
snow, than a young warrior is seen approaching them.
He is thus described: <q>A shirt of royal satin was next
his skin; over and outside it a tunic of the same fabric;
and a fringed crimson mantle, confined with a bodkin
<pb n='286' id='page286'/>
of gold, upon his breast; in his hand a gold-hilted
sword, and a golden helmet on his head.</q> A delight
in the colour and material splendour of life is a very
marked feature in all this literature. This splendid
figure turns out to be Donn mac Midir, one of the
eight-and-twenty whom Finn had succoured, and he
comes to do homage for himself and his people to
St. Patrick, who accepts entertainment from him for
the night; for in the <q>Colloquy</q> the relations of
the Church and of the Fairy World are very cordial.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Three Young Warriors</hi>
</p>

<p>
Nowhere in Celtic literature does the love of wonder
and mystery find such remarkable expression as in
the <q>Colloquy.</q> The writer of this piece was a master
of the touch that makes, as it were, the solid framework
of things translucent; and shows us, through it, gleams
of another world, mingled with ours yet distinct, and
having other laws and characteristics. We never get a
clue as to what these laws are. The Celt did not, in
Ireland at least, systematise the unknown, but let it
shine for a moment through the opaqueness of this
earth and then withdrew the gleam before we understood
what we had seen. Take, for instance, this
incident in Keelta's account of the Fianna. Three
young warriors come to take service with Finn,
accompanied by a gigantic hound. They make their
agreement with him, saying what services they can
render and what reward they expect, and they make it
a condition that they shall camp apart from the rest of
the host, and that when night has fallen no man shall
come near them or see them.
</p>

<p>
Finn asks the reason for this prohibition, and it is this:
of the three warriors one has to die each night, and the
other two must watch him; therefore they would not
<pb n='287' id='page287'/>
be disturbed. There is no explanation of this; the
writer simply leaves us with the thrill of the mystery
upon us.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Fair Giantess</hi>
</p>

<p>
Again, let us turn to the tale of the Fair Giantess.
One day Finn and his warriors, while resting from the
chase for their midday meal, saw coming towards them
a towering shape. It proved to be a young giant
maiden, who gave her name as Vivionn (Bebhionn)
daughter of Treon, from the Land of Maidens. The
gold rings on her fingers were as thick as an ox's yoke,
and her beauty was dazzling. When she took off her
gilded helmet, all bejewelled, her fair, curling golden hair
broke out in seven score tresses, and Finn cried: <q>Great
gods whom we adore, a huge marvel Cormac and Ethné
and the women of the Fianna would esteem it to see
Vivionn, the blooming daughter of Treon.</q> The maiden
explained that she had been betrothed against her will to
a suitor named Æda, son of a neighbouring king; and
that hearing from a fisherman, who had been blown to
her shores, of the power and nobleness of Finn, she had
come to seek his protection. While she was speaking,
suddenly the Fianna were aware of another giant form
close at hand. It was a young man, smooth-featured
and of surpassing beauty, who bore a red shield and a huge
spear. Without a word he drew near, and before the
wondering Fianna could accost him he thrust his spear
through the body of the maiden and passed away. Finn,
enraged at this violation of his protection, called on his
chiefs to pursue and slay the murderer. Keelta and
others chased him to the sea-shore, and followed him into
the surf, but he strode out to sea, and was met by a
great galley which bore him away to unknown regions.
Returning, discomfited, to Finn, they found the girl
<pb n='288' id='page288'/>
dying. She distributed her gold and jewels among them,
and the Fianna buried her under a great mound, and
raised a pillar stone over her with her name in Ogham
letters, in the place since called the Ridge of the Dead
Woman.
</p>

<p>
In this tale we have, besides the element of mystery,
that of beauty. It is an association of frequent occurrence
in this period of Celtic literature; and to this, perhaps,
is due the fact that although these tales seem to come
from nowhither and to lead nowhither, but move in a
dream-world where there is no chase but seems to end in
Fairyland and no combat that has any relation to earthly
needs or objects, where all realities are apt to dissolve in
a magic light and to change their shapes like morning
mist, yet they linger in the memory with that haunting
charm which has for many centuries kept them alive by
the fireside of the Gaelic peasant.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>St. Patrick, Oisīn, and Keelta</hi>
</p>

<p>
Before we leave the <q>Colloquy</q> another interesting
point must be mentioned in connexion with it. To the
general public probably the best-known things in Ossianic
literature&mdash;I refer, of course, to the true Gaelic poetry
which goes under that name, not to the pseudo-Ossian
of Macpherson&mdash;are those dialogues in which the pagan
and the Christian ideals are contrasted, often in a spirit of
humorous exaggeration or of satire. The earliest of these
pieces are found in the manuscript called <q>The Dean of
Lismore's Book,</q> in which James Macgregor, Dean of
Lismore in Argyllshire,wrote down, some time before the
year 1518, all he could remember or discover of traditional
Gaelic poetry in his time. It may be observed that up to
this period, and, indeed, long after it, Scottish and Irish
Gaelic were one language and one literature, the great
written monuments of which were in Ireland, though they
<pb n='289' id='page289'/>
belonged just as much to the Highland Celt, and the
two branches of the Gael had an absolutely common
stock of poetic tradition. These Oisīn-and-Patrick
dialogues are found in abundance both in Ireland and
in the Highlands, though, as I have said, <q>The Dean of
Lismore's Book</q> is their first written record now extant.
What relation, then, do these dialogues bear to the
Keelta-and-Patrick dialogues with which we make acquaintance
in the <q>Colloquy</q>? The questions which
really came first, where they respectively originated, and
what current of thought or sentiment each represented,
constitute, as Mr. Alfred Nutt has pointed out, a literary
problem of the greatest interest; and one which no critic
has yet attempted to solve, or, indeed, until quite lately,
even to call attention to. For though these two attempts
to represent, in imaginative and artistic form, the contact
of paganism with Christianity are nearly identical in
machinery and framework, save that one is in verse and
the other in prose, yet they differ widely in their point
of view.
</p>

<p>
In the Oisīn dialogues<note place='foot'><p>
Examples of these have been published, with translations, in the
<q>Transactions of the Ossianic Society.</q>
</p></note> there is a great deal of rough
humour and of crude theology, resembling those of an
English miracle-play rather than any Celtic product that
I am acquainted with. St. Patrick in these ballads, as
Mr. Nutt remarks, <q>is a sour and stupid fanatic, harping
with wearisome monotony on the damnation of Finn
and all his comrades; a hard taskmaster to the poor old
blind giant to whom he grudges food, and upon whom
he plays shabby tricks in order to terrify him into acceptance
of Christianity.</q> Now in the <q>Colloquy</q> there
is not one word of all this. Keelta embraces Christianity
with a wholehearted reverence, and salvation is not
denied to the friends and companions of his youth.
<pb n='290' id='page290'/>
Patrick, indeed, assures Keelta of the salvation of several
of them, including Finn himself. One of the Danaan
Folk, who has been bard to the Fianna, delighted Patrick
with his minstrelsy. Brogan, the scribe whom St. Patrick
is employing to write down the Fian legends, says: <q>If
music there is in heaven, why should there not be on
earth? Wherefore it is not right to banish minstrelsy.</q>
Patrick made answer: <q>Neither say I any such thing</q>;
and, in fact, the minstrel is promised heaven for his art.
</p>

<p>
Such are the pleasant relations that prevail in the
<q>Colloquy</q> between the representatives of the two
epochs. Keelta represents all that is courteous, dignified,
generous, and valorous in paganism, and Patrick all that
is benign and gracious in Christianity; and instead of
the two epochs standing over against each other in
violent antagonism, and separated by an impassable
gulf, all the finest traits in each are seen to harmonise
with and to supplement those of the other.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Tales of Dermot</hi>
</p>

<p>
A number of curious legends centre on Dermot
O'Dyna, who has been referred to as one of Finn mac
Cumhal's most notable followers. He might be described
as a kind of Gaelic Adonis, a type of beauty and attraction,
the hero of innumerable love tales; and, like
Adonis, his death was caused by a wild boar.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Boar of Ben Bulben</hi>
</p>

<p>
The boar was no common beast. The story of its
origin was as follows: Dermot's father, Donn, gave the
child to be nurtured by Angus Ōg in his palace on the
Boyne. His mother, who was unfaithful to Donn, bore
another child to Roc, the steward of Angus. Donn,
one day, when the steward's child ran between his knees
to escape from some hounds that were fighting on the
<pb n='291' id='page291'/>
floor of the hall, gave him a squeeze with his two knees
that killed him on the spot, and he then flung the body
among the hounds on the floor. When the steward
found his son dead, and discovered (with Finn's aid)
the cause of it, he brought a Druid rod and smote the
body with it, whereupon, in place of the dead child,
there arose a huge boar, without ears or tail; and to it
he spake: <q>I charge you to bring Dermot O'Dyna to
his death</q>; and the boar rushed out from the hall and
roamed in the forests of Ben Bulben in Co. Sligo till the
time when his destiny should be fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
But Dermot grew up into a splendid youth, tireless
in the chase, undaunted in war, beloved by all his comrades
of the Fianna, whom he joined as soon as he was
of age to do so.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>How Dermot Got the Love Spot</hi>
</p>

<p>
He was called Dermot of the Love Spot, and a
curious and beautiful folk-tale recorded by Dr. Douglas
Hyde<note place='foot'><p>
Taken down from the recital of a peasant in Co. Galway and
published at Rennes in Dr. Hyde's <q>An Sgeuluidhe Gaodhalach,</q>
vol. ii. (no translation).
</p></note> tells how he got this appellation. With three
comrades, Goll, Conan, and Oscar, he was hunting one
day, and late at night they sought a resting-place. They
soon found a hut, in which were an old man, a young
girl, a wether sheep, and a cat. Here they asked for
hospitality, and it was granted to them. But, as usual
in these tales, it was a house of mystery.
</p>

<p>
When they sat down to dinner the wether got up and
mounted on the table. One after another the Fianna
strove to throw it off, but it shook them down on the
floor. At last Goll succeeded in flinging it off the table,
but him too it vanquished in the end, and put them
all under its feet. Then the old man bade the cat lead
<pb n='292' id='page292'/>
the wether back and fasten it up, and it did so easily.
The four champions, overcome with shame, were for
leaving the house at once; but the old man explained
that they had suffered no discredit&mdash;the wether they
had been fighting with was the World, and the cat was
the power that would destroy the world itself, namely,
Death.
</p>

<p>
At night the four heroes went to rest in a large
chamber, and the young maid came to sleep in the same
room; and it is said that her beauty made a light on the
walls of the room like a candle. One after another the
Fianna went over to her couch, but she repelled them
all. <q>I belonged to you once,</q> she said to each,
<q>and I never will again.</q> Last of all Dermot went.
<q>O Dermot,</q> she said, <q>you, also, I belonged to once,
and I never can again, for I am Youth; but come here
and I will put a mark on you so that no woman can
ever see you without loving you.</q> Then she touched
his forehead, and left the Love Spot there; and that
drew the love of women to him as long as he lived.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Chase of the Hard Gilly</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Chase of the Gilla Dacar is another Fian tale in
which Dermot plays a leading part. The Fianna, the
story goes, were hunting one day on the hills and
through the woods of Munster, and as Finn and his
captains stood on a hillside listening to the baying of
the hounds, and the notes of the Fian hunting-horn
from the dark wood below, they saw coming towards
them a huge, ugly, misshapen churl dragging along by
a halter a great raw-boned mare. He announced himself
as wishful to take service with Finn. The name
he was called by, he said, was the Gilla Dacar (the Hard
Gilly), because he was the hardest servant ever a lord
had to get service or obedience from. In spite of this
<pb n='293' id='page293'/>
unpromising beginning, Finn, whose principle it was
never to refuse any suitor, took him into service; and
the Fianna now began to make their uncouth comrade the
butt of all sorts of rough jokes, which ended in thirteen
of them, including Conan the Bald, all mounting up on
the Gilla Dacar's steed. On this the newcomer complained
that he was being mocked, and he shambled
away in great discontent till he was over the ridge of
the hill, when he tucked up his skirts and ran westwards,
faster than any March wind, toward the sea-shore in
Co. Kerry. Thereupon at once the steed, which had
stood still with drooping ears while the thirteen riders
in vain belaboured it to make it move, suddenly
threw up its head and started off in a furious gallop
after its master. The Fianna ran alongside, as well
as they could for laughter, while Conan, in terror
and rage, reviled them for not rescuing him and his
comrades. At last the thing became serious. The Gilla
Dacar plunged into the sea, and the mare followed him
with her thirteen riders, and one more who managed to
cling to her tail just as she left the shore; and all of
them soon disappeared towards the fabled region of the
West.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Dermot at the Well</hi>
</p>

<p>
Finn and the remaining Fianna now took counsel
together as to what should be done, and finally decided
to fit out a ship and go in search of their comrades.
After many days of voyaging they reached an island
guarded by precipitous cliffs. Dermot O'Dyna, as the
most agile of the party, was sent to climb them and to
discover, if he could, some means of helping up the
rest of the party. When he arrived at the top he found
himself in a delightful land, full of the song of birds
and the humming of bees and the murmur of streams,
<pb n='294' id='page294'/>
but with no sign of habitation. Going into a dark
forest, he soon came to a well, by which hung a curiously
wrought drinking-horn. As he filled it to drink, a low,
threatening murmur came from the well, but his thirst
was too keen to let him heed it and he drank his fill.
In no long time there came through the wood an armed
warrior, who violently upbraided him for drinking from
his well. The Knight of the Well and Dermot then
fought all the afternoon without either of them prevailing
over the other, when, as evening drew on, the knight
suddenly leaped into the well and disappeared. Next
day the same thing happened; on the third, however,
Dermot, as the knight was about to take his leap, flung
his arms round him, and both went down together.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Rescue of Fairyland</hi>
</p>

<p>
Dermot, after a moment of darkness and trance, now
found himself in Fairyland. A man of noble appearance
roused him and led him away to the castle of a great king,
where he was hospitably entertained. It was explained
to him that the services of a champion like himself were
needed to do combat against a rival monarch of Faëry.
It is the same motive which we find in the adventures
of Cuchulain with Fand, and which so frequently turns
up in Celtic fairy lore. Finn and his companions, finding
that Dermot did not return to them, found their way
up the cliffs, and, having traversed the forest, entered a
great cavern which ultimately led them out to the same
land as that in which Dermot had arrived. There too,
they are informed, are the fourteen Fianna who had
been carried off on the mare of the Hard Gilly. He,
of course, was the king who needed their services, and
who had taken this method of decoying some thirty of
the flower of Irish fighting men to his side. Finn and
his men go into the battle with the best of goodwill,
<pb n='295' id='page295'/>
and scatter the enemy like chaff; Oscar slays the son
of the rival king (who is called the King of <q>Greece</q>).
Finn wins the love of his daughter, Tasha of the White
Arms, and the story closes with a delightful mixture of
gaiety and mystery. <q>What reward wilt thou have for
thy good services?</q> asks the fairy king of Finn. <q>Thou
wert once in service with me,</q> replies Finn, <q>and I
mind not that I gave thee any recompense. Let one
service stand against the other.</q> <q>Never shall I agree
to that,</q> cries Conan the Bald. <q>Shall I have nought
for being carried off on thy wild mare and haled oversea?</q>
<q>What wilt thou have?</q> asks the fairy king.
<q>None of thy gold or goods,</q> replies Conan, <q>but
mine honour hath suffered, and let mine honour be
appeased. Set thirteen of thy fairest womenfolk on the
wild mare, O King, and thine own wife clinging to her
tail, and let them be transported to Erin in like manner
as we were dragged here, and I shall deem the indignity
we have suffered fitly atoned for.</q> On this the king
smiled and, turning to Finn, said: <q>O Finn, behold
thy men.</q> Finn turned to look at them, but when he
looked round again the scene had changed&mdash;the fairy
king and his host and all the world of Faëry had
disappeared, and he found himself with his companions
and the fair-armed Tasha standing on the beach of the
little bay in Kerry whence the Hard Gilly and the mare
had taken the water and carried off his men. And then
all started with cheerful hearts for the great standing
camp of the Fianna on the Hill of Allen to celebrate
the wedding feast of Finn and Tasha.

<hi rend='bold'>Effect of Christianity on the Development of Irish Literature</hi>
</p>

<p>
This tale with its fascinating mixture of humour,
romance, magic, and love of wild nature, may be taken
as a typical specimen of the Fian legends at their best.
<pb n='296' id='page296'/>
As compared with the Conorian legends they show, as
I have pointed out, a characteristic lack of any heroic or
serious element. That nobler strain died out with the
growing predominance of Christianity, which appropriated
for definitely religious purposes the more serious
and lofty side of the Celtic genius, leaving for secular
literature only the elements of wonder and romance.
So completely was this carried out that while the Finn
legends have survived to this day among the Gaelic-speaking
population, and were a subject of literary treatment
as long as Gaelic was written at all, the earlier cycle
perished almost completely out of the popular remembrance,
or survived only in distorted forms; and but
for the early manuscripts in which the tales are fortunately
enshrined such a work as the <q>Tain Bo Cuailgné</q>&mdash;the
greatest thing undoubtedly which the Celtic genius ever
produced in literature&mdash;would now be irrecoverably lost.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tales of Deirdre and of Grania</hi>
</p>

<p>
Nothing can better illustrate the difference between
the two cycles than a comparison of the tale of Deirdre
with that with which we have now to deal&mdash;the tale
of Dermot and Grania. The latter, from one point
of view, reads like an echo of the former, so close is
the resemblance between them in the outline of the
plot. Take the following skeleton story: <q>A fair
maiden is betrothed to a renowned and mighty suitor
much older than herself. She turns from him to seek
a younger lover, and fixes her attention on one of his
followers, a gallant and beautiful youth, whom she persuades,
in spite of his reluctance, to fly with her. After
evading pursuit they settle down for a while at a distance
from the defrauded lover, who bides his time, till
at last, under cover of a treacherous reconciliation, he
procures the death of his younger rival and retakes
<pb n='297' id='page297'/>
possession of the lady.</q> Were a student of Celtic
legend asked to listen to the above synopsis, and to say
to what Irish tale it referred, he would certainly reply
that it must be either the tale of the Pursuit of Dermot
and Grania, or that of the Fate of the Sons of Usna;
but which of them it was it would be quite impossible
for him to tell. Yet in tone and temper the two stories
are as wide apart as the poles.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Grania and Dermot</hi>
</p>

<p>
Grania, in the Fian story, is the daughter of Cormac
mac Art, High King of Ireland. She is betrothed to
Finn mac Cumhal, whom we are to regard at this period
as an old and war-worn but still mighty warrior. The
famous captains of the Fianna all assemble at Tara for
the wedding feast, and as they sit at meat Grania surveys
them and asks their names of her father's Druid, Dara.
<q>It is a wonder,</q> she says, <q>that Finn did not ask me
for Oisīn, rather than for himself.</q> <q>Oisīn would not
dare to take thee,</q> says Dara. Grania, after going
through all the company, asks: <q>Who is that man with
the spot on his brow, with the sweet voice, with curling
dusky hair and ruddy cheek?</q> <q>That is Dermot
O'Dyna,</q> replies the Druid, <q>the white-toothed, of
the lightsome countenance, in all the world the best
lover of women and maidens.</q> Grania now prepares
a sleepy draught, which she places in a drinking-cup
and passes round by her handmaid to the king, to Finn,
and to all the company except the chiefs of the Fianna.
When the draught has done its work she goes to Oisīn.
<q>Wilt thou receive courtship from me, Oisīn?</q> she
asks. <q>That will I not,</q> says Oisīn, <q>nor from any
woman that is betrothed to Finn.</q> Grania, who knew
very well what Oisīn's answer would be, now turns to
her real mark, Dermot. He at first refuses to have
<pb n='298' id='page298'/>
anything to do with her. <q>I put thee under bonds
[<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign>],  O Dermot, that thou take me out of Tara to-night.</q>
<q>Evil are these bonds, Grania,</q> says Dermot;
<q>and wherefore hast thou put them on me before all
the kings' sons that feast at this table?</q> Grania then
explains that she has loved Dermot ever since she saw
him, years ago, from her sunny bower, take part in and
win a great hurling match on the green at Tara.
Dermot, still very reluctant, pleads the merits of Finn,
and urges also that Finn has the keys of the royal
fortress, so that they cannot pass out at night. <q>There
is a secret wicket-gate in my bower,</q> says Grania. <q>I
am under <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> not to pass through any wicket-gate,</q>
replies Dermot, still struggling against his destiny.
Grania will have none of these subterfuges&mdash;any Fian
warrior, she has been told, can leap over a palisade with
the aid of his spear as a jumping-pole; and she goes off
to make ready for the elopement. Dermot, in great
perplexity, appeals to Oisīn, Oscar, Keelta, and the
others as to what he should do. They all bid him
keep his <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign>&mdash;the bonds that Grania had laid on
him to succour her&mdash;and he takes leave of them with
tears.
</p>

<p>
Outside the wicket-gate he again begs Grania to
return. <q>It is certain that I will not go back,</q> says
Grania, <q>nor part from thee till death part us.</q> <q>Then
go forward, O Grania,</q> says Dermot. After they had
gone a mile, <q>I am truly weary, O grandson of Dyna,</q>
says Grania. <q>It is a good time to be weary,</q> says
Dermot, making a last effort to rid himself of the
entanglement, <q>and return now to thy household again,
for I pledge the word of a true warrior that I will never
carry thee nor any other woman to all eternity.</q> <q>There
is no need,</q> replies Grania, and she directs him where
to find horses and a chariot, and Dermot, now finally
<pb n='299' id='page299'/>
accepting the inevitable, yokes them, and they proceed
on their way to the Ford of Luan on the Shannon.<note place='foot'><p>
Now Athlone (<foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Atha Luain</foreign>).
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Pursuit</hi>
</p>

<p>
Next day Finn, burning with rage, sets out with his
warriors on their track. He traces out each of their
halting-places, and finds the hut of wattles which
Dermot has made for their shelter, and the bed of soft
rushes, and the remains of the meal they had eaten.
And at each place he finds a piece of unbroken bread
or uncooked salmon&mdash;Dermot's subtle message to
Finn that he has respected the rights of his lord and
treated Grania as a sister. But this delicacy of Dermot's
is not at all to Crania's mind, and she conveys her
wishes to him in a manner which is curiously paralleled
by an episode in the tale of Tristan and Iseult of
Brittany, as told by Heinrich von Freiberg. They are
passing through a piece of wet ground when a splash
of water strikes Grania. She turns to her companion:
<q>Thou art a mighty warrior, O Dermot, in battle and
sieges and forays, yet meseems that this drop of water
is bolder than thou.</q> This hint that he was keeping
at too respectful a distance was taken by Dermot.
The die is now cast, and he will never again meet
Finn and his old comrades except at the point of the
spear.
</p>

<p>
The tale now loses much of the originality and charm
of its opening scene, and recounts in a somewhat
mechanical manner a number of episodes in which
Dermot is attacked or besieged by the Fianna, and
rescues himself and his lady by miracles of boldness or
dexterity, or by aid of the magical devices of his foster-father,
Angus Ōg. They are chased all over Ireland,
and the dolmens in that country are popularly associated
<pb n='300' id='page300'/>
with them, being called in the traditions of the peasantry
<q>Beds of Dermot and Grania.</q>
</p>

<p>
Grania's character is drawn throughout with great
consistency. She is not an heroic woman&mdash;hers are
not the simple, ardent impulses and unwavering devotion
of a Deirdre. The latter is far more primitive.
Grania is a curiously modern and what would be called
<q>neurotic</q> type&mdash;wilful, restless, passionate, but full
of feminine fascination.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Dermot and Finn Make Peace</hi>
</p>

<p>
After sixteen years of outlawry peace is at last made
for Dermot by the mediation or Angus with King
Cormac and with Finn. Dermot receives his proper
patrimony, the Cantred of O'Dyna, and other lands
far away in the West, and Cormac gives another of his
daughters to Finn. <q>Peaceably they abode a long time
with each other, and it was said that no man then living
was richer in gold and silver, in flocks and herds, than
Dermot O'Dyna, nor one that made more preys.</q><note place='foot'><p>
How significant is this naïve indication that the making of
forays on his neighbours was regarded in Celtic Ireland as the
natural and laudable occupation of a country gentleman! Compare
Spenser's account of the ideals fostered by the Irish bards of his
time, <q>View of the Present State of Ireland,</q> p. 641 (Globe
edition).
</p></note>
Grania bears to Dermot four sons and a daughter.
</p>

<p>
But Grania is not satisfied until <q>the two best men
that are in Erin, namely, Cormac son of Art and Finn
son of Cumhal,</q> have been entertained in her house.
<q>And how do we know,</q> she adds, <q>but our daughter
might then get a fitting husband?</q> Dermot agrees
with some misgiving; the king and Finn accept the
invitation, and they and their retinues are feasted for
a year at Rath Grania.
</p>

<pb n='301' id='page301'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Vengeance of Finn</hi>
</p>

<p>
Then one night, towards the end of the year of feasting,
Dermot is awakened from sleep by the baying of
a hound. He starts up, <q>so that Grania caught him
and threw her two arms about him and asked him
what he had seen.</q> <q>It is the voice of a hound,</q> says
Dermot, <q>and I marvel to hear it in the night.</q> <q>Save
and protect thee,</q> says Grania; <q>it is the Danaan Folk
that are at work on thee. Lay thee down again.</q> But
three times the hound's voice awakens him, and on the
morrow he goes forth armed with sword and sling, and
followed by his own hound, to see what is afoot.
</p>

<p>
On the mountain of Ben Bulben in Sligo he comes
across Finn with a hunting-party of the Fianna. They
are not now hunting, however; they are being hunted;
for they have roused up the enchanted boar without
ears or tail, the Boar of Ben Bulben, which has slain
thirty of them that morning. <q>And do thou come
away,</q> says Finn, knowing well that Dermot will never
retreat from a danger; <q>for thou art under <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geise</foreign> not to
hunt pig.</q> <q>How is that?</q> says Dermot, and Finn
then tells him the weird story of the death of the
steward's son and his revivification in the form of this
boar, with its mission of vengeance. <q>By my word,</q>
quoth Dermot, <q>it is to slay me that thou hast made
this hunt, O Finn; and if it be here that I am fated to
die, I have no power now to shun it.</q>
</p>

<p>
The beast then appears on the face of the mountain,
and Dermot slips the hound at him, but the hound flies
in terror. Dermot then slings a stone which strikes
the boar fairly in the middle of his forehead but does
not even scratch his skin. The beast is close on him
now, and Dermot strikes him with his sword, but the
weapon flies in two and not a bristle of the boar is cut.
<pb n='302' id='page302'/>
In the charge of the boar Dermot falls over him, and is
carried for a space clinging to his back; but at last the
boar shakes him off to the ground, and making <q>an
eager, exceeding mighty spring</q> upon him, rips out his
bowels, while at the same time, with the hilt of the
sword still in his hand, Dermot dashes out the brains
of the beast, and it falls dead beside him.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Death of Dermot</hi>
</p>

<p>
The implacable Finn then comes up, and stands over
Dermot in his agony. <q>It likes me well to see thee in
that plight, O Dermot,</q> he says, <q>and I would that all
the women in Ireland saw thee now; for thy excellent
beauty is turned to ugliness and thy choice form to
deformity.</q> Dermot reminds Finn of how he once
rescued him from deadly peril when attacked during
a feast at the house of Derc, and begs him to heal
him with a draught of water from his hands, for Finn
had the magic gift of restoring any wounded man to
health with a draught of well-water drawn in his two
hands. <q>Here is no well,</q> says Finn. <q>That is not
true,</q> says Dermot, <q>for nine paces from you is the
best well of pure water in the world.</q> Finn, at last,
on the entreaty of Oscar and the Fianna, and after the
recital of many deeds done for his sake by Dermot in
old days, goes to the well, but ere he brings the water
to Dermot's side he lets it fall through his fingers. A
second time he goes, and a second time he lets the
water fall, <q>having thought upon Grania,</q> and Dermot
gave a sigh of anguish on seeing it. Oscar then
declares that if Finn does not bring the water promptly
either he or Finn shall never leave the hill alive, and
Finn goes once more to the well, but it is now too late;
Dermot is dead before the healing draught can reach
his lips. Then Finn takes the hound of Dermot, the
<pb n='303' id='page303'/>
chiefs of the Fianna lay their cloaks over the dead man,
and they return to Rath Grania. Grania, seeing the
hound led by Finn, conjectures what has happened, and
swoons upon the rampart of the Rath. Oisīn, when
she has revived, gives her the hound, against Finn's
will, and the Fianna troop away, leaving her to her
sorrow. When the people of Grania's household go
out to fetch in the body of Dermot they find there
Angus Ōg and his company of the People of Dana,
who, after raising three bitter and terrible cries, bear
away the body on a gilded bier, and Angus declares
that though he cannot restore the dead to life, <q>I will
send a soul into him so that he may talk with me
each day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The End of Grania</hi>
</p>

<p>
To a tale like this modern taste demands a romantic
and sentimental ending; and such has actually been
given to it in the retelling by Dr. P. W. Joyce in his
<q>Old Celtic Romances,</q> as it has to the tale of Deirdre
by almost every modern writer who has handled it.<note place='foot'><p>
Dr. John Todhunter, in his <q>Three Irish Bardic Tales,</q> has
alone, I think, kept the antique ending of the tale of Deirdre.
</p></note>
But the Celtic story-teller felt differently. The tale of
the end of Deirdre is horribly cruel, that of Grania
cynical and mocking; neither is in the least sentimental.
Grania is at first enraged with Finn, and sends her sons
abroad to learn feats of arms, so that they may take
vengeance upon him when the time is ripe. But Finn,
wily and far-seeing as he is portrayed in this tale, knows
how to forestall this danger. When the tragedy on Ben
Bulben has begun to grow a little faint in the shallow
soul of Grania, he betakes himself to her, and though
met at first with scorn and indignation he woos her so
sweetly and with such tenderness that at last he brings
<pb n='304' id='page304'/>
her to his will, and he bears her back as a bride to
the Hill of Allen. When the Fianna see the pair
coming towards them in this loving guise they burst
into a shout of laughter and derision, <q>so that Grania
bowed her head in shame.</q> <q>We trow, O Finn,</q> cries
Oisīn, <q>that thou wilt keep Grania well from henceforth.</q>
So Grania made peace between Finn and her
sons, and dwelt with Finn as his wife until he died.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Two Streams of Fian Legends</hi>
</p>

<p>
It will be noticed that in this legend Finn does not
appear as a sympathetic character. Our interest is all
on the side of Dermot. In this aspect of it the tale is
typical of a certain class of Fian stories. Just as there
were two rival clans within the Fian organisation&mdash;the
Clan Bascna and the Clan Morna&mdash;who sometimes came
to blows for the supremacy, so there are two streams of
legends seeming to flow respectively from one or other
of these sources, in one of which Finn is glorified, while
in the other he is belittled in favour of Goll mac Morna
or any other hero with whom he comes into conflict.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>End of the Fianna</hi>
</p>

<p>
The story of the end of the Fianna is told in a number
of pieces, some prose, some poetry, all of them, however,
agreeing in presenting this event as a piece of sober
history, without any of the supernatural and mystical atmosphere
in which nearly all the Fian legends are steeped.
</p>

<p>
After the death of Cormac mac Art his son Cairbry
came to the High-Kingship of Ireland. He had a fair
daughter named <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Sgeimh Solais</foreign> (Light of Beauty), who
was asked in marriage by a son of the King of the Decies.
The marriage was arranged, and the Fianna claimed
a ransom or tribute of twenty ingots of gold, which, it
is said, was customarily paid to them on these occasions.
<pb n='305' id='page305'/>
It would seem that the Fianna had now grown to be a
distinct power within the State, and an oppressive one,
exacting heavy tributes and burdensome privileges from
kings and sub-kings all over Ireland. Cairbry resolved
to break them; and he thought he had now a good
opportunity to do so. He therefore refused payment
of the ransom, and summoned all the provincial kings
to help him against the Fianna, the main body of
whom immediately went into rebellion for what they
deemed their rights. The old feud between Clan Bascna
and Clan Morna now broke out afresh, the latter standing
by the High King, while Clan Bascna, aided by the King
of Munster and his forces, who alone took their side,
marched against Cairbry.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Battle of Gowra</hi>
</p>

<p>
All this sounds very matter-of-fact and probable, but
how much real history there may be in it it is very hard
to say. The decisive battle of the war which ensued
took place at Gowra (Gabhra), the name of which survives
in Garristown, Co. Dublin. The rival forces, when
drawn up in battle array, knelt and kissed the sacred
soil of Erin before they charged. The story of the
battle in the poetical versions, one of which is published
in the Ossianic Society's <q>Transactions,</q> and another
and finer one in Campbell's <q>The Fians,</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition,</q> Argyllshire Series.
The tale was taken down in verse, word for word, from the dictation
of Roderick mac Fadyen in Tiree, 1868.

to be related by Oisīn to St. Patrick. He lays great
stress on the feats of his son Oscar:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>My son urged his course</q></l>
<l>Through the battalions of Tara</l>
<l>Like a hawk through a flock of birds,</l>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Death of Oscar</hi>
</p>

<p>
The fight was <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à outrance</foreign>, and the slaughter on both
sides tremendous. None but old men and boys, it is
said, were left in Erin after that fight. The Fianna were
in the end almost entirely exterminated, and Oscar slain.
He and the King of Ireland, Cairbry, met in single
combat, and each of them slew the other. While Oscar
was still breathing, though there was not a palm's
breadth on his body without a wound, his father found
him:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>I found my own son lying down</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>On his left elbow, his shield by his side;</l>

<l rend='margin-left: 1'>Woe to me was that sight!</l>

<p>
When Finn (in the Scottish version) comes to bewail
his grandson, he cries:
</p>

<l rend='margin-left: 1'>In the fight of bare sunny Gavra,</l>

<p>
But Oscar replies:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Were it you that fell</q></l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>In the fight of bare sunny Gavra,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 1'>One sigh, east or west,</l>

<l rend='margin-left: 1'><q rend='pre: none'>'Tis that vexes my heart.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Oscar dies, after thanking the gods for his father's
safety, and Oisīn and Keelta raise him on a bier of spears
and carry him off under his banner, <q>The Terrible
Sheaf,</q> for burial on the field where he died, and where a
great green burial mound is still associated with his name.
Finn takes no part in the battle. He is said to have
come <q>in a ship</q> to view the field afterwards, and he
wept over Oscar, a thing he had never done save once
before, for his hound, Bran, whom he himself killed
by accident. Possibly the reference to the ship is an
indication that he had by this time passed away, and came
to revisit the earth from the oversea kingdom of Death.
</p>

<p>
There is in this tale of the Battle of Gowra a melancholy
grandeur which gives it a place apart in the
Ossianic literature. It is a fitting dirge for a great
legendary epoch. Campbell tells us that the Scottish
crofters and shepherds were wont to put off their bonnets
when they recited it. He adds a strange and thrilling
piece of modern folk-lore bearing on it. Two men, it is
said, were out at night, probably sheep-stealing or on
some other predatory occupation, and telling Fian tales
as they went, when they observed two giant and shadowy
figures talking to each other across the glen. One of
the apparitions said to the other: <q>Do you see that man
down below? I was the second door-post of battle on
the day of Gowra, and that man there knows all about
it better than myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The End of Finn</hi>
</p>

<p>
As to Finn himself, it is strange that in all the
extant mass of the Ossianic literature there should be no
complete narrative of his death. There are references to
it in the poetic legends, and annalists even date it, but
the references conflict with each other, and so do the
dates. There is no clear light to be obtained on the
subject from either annalists or poets. Finn seems to
have melted into the magic mist which enwraps so
many of his deeds in life. Yet a popular tradition says
that he and his great companions, Oscar and Keelta and
Oisīn and the rest, never died, but lie, like Kaiser
Barbarossa, spell-bound in an enchanted cave where
they await the appointed time to reappear in glory and
redeem their land from tyranny and wrong.

CHAPTER VII: THE VOYAGE OF MAELDŪN
</head>

<p>
Besides the legends which cluster round great
heroic names, and have, or at least pretend to
have, the character of history, there are many
others, great and small, which tell of adventures lying
purely in regions of romance, and out of earthly space
and time. As a specimen of these I give here a
summary of the <q>Voyage of Maeldūn,</q> a most curious
and brilliant piece of invention, which is found in the
manuscript entitled the <q>Book of the Dun Cow</q>
(about 1100) and other early sources, and edited, with
a translation (to which I owe the following extracts),
by Dr. Whitley Stokes in the <q>Revue Celtique</q> for 1888
and 1889. It is only one of a number of such
wonder-voyages found in ancient Irish literature, but
it is believed to have been the earliest of them all and
model for the rest, and it has had the distinction, in
the abridged and modified form given by Joyce in his
<q>Old Celtic Romances,</q> of having furnished the theme
for the <q>Voyage of Maeldune</q> to Tennyson, who
made it into a wonderful creation of rhythm and
colour, embodying a kind of allegory of Irish history.
It will be noticed at the end that we are in the unusual
position of knowing the name of the author of this
piece of primitive literature, though he does not claim
to have composed, but only to have <q>put in order,</q>
the incidents of the <q>Voyage.</q> Unfortunately we cannot
tell when he lived, but the tale as we have it probably
dates from the ninth century. Its atmosphere is
entirely Christian, and it has no mythological significance
except in so far as it teaches the lesson that the
oracular injunctions of wizards should be obeyed. No
adventure, or even detail, of importance is omitted in
<pb n='310' id='page310'/>
the following summary of the story, which is given
thus fully because the reader may take it as representing
a large and important section of Irish legendary romance.
Apart from the source to which I am indebted, the
<q>Revue Celtique,</q> I know no other faithful reproduction
in English of this wonderful tale.
</p>

<p>
The <q>Voyage of Maeldūn</q> begins, as Irish tales
often do, by telling us of the conception of its hero.
</p>

<p>
There was a famous man of the sept of the Owens
of Aran, named Ailill Edge-of-Battle, who went with
his king on a foray into another territory. They
encamped one night near a church and convent of
nuns. At midnight Ailill, who was near the church,
saw a certain nun come out to strike the bell for
nocturns, and caught her by the hand. In ancient
Ireland religious persons were not much respected in
time of war, and Ailill did not respect her. When
they parted, she said to him: <q>Whence is thy race,
and what is thy name?</q> Said the hero: <q>Ailill
of the Edge-of-Battle is my name, and I am of the
Owenacht of Aran, in Thomond.</q>
</p>

<p>
Not long afterwards Ailill was slain by reavers from
Leix, who burned the church of Doocloone over his head.
</p>

<p>
In due time a son was born to the woman and she
called his name Maeldūn. He was taken secretly to
her friend, the queen of the territory, and by her
Maeldūn was reared. <q>Beautiful indeed was his
form, and it is doubtful if there hath been in flesh
any one so beautiful as he. So he grew up till he was
a young warrior and fit to use weapons. Great, then,
was his brightness and his gaiety and his playfulness.
In his play he outwent all his comrades in throwing
balls, and in running and leaping and putting stones
and racing horses.</q>
</p>

<p>
One day a proud young warrior who had been
<pb n='311' id='page311'/>
defeated by him taunted him with his lack of
knowledge of his kindred and descent. Maeldūn
went to his foster-mother, the queen, and said: <q>I
will not eat nor drink till thou tell me who are my
mother and my father.</q> <q>I am thy mother,</q> said the
queen, <q>for none ever loved her son more than I love
thee.</q> But Maeldūn insisted on knowing all, and the
queen at last took him to his own mother, the nun,
who told him: <q>Thy father was Ailill of the Owens of
Aran.</q> Then Maeldūn went to his own kindred, and
was well received by them; and with him he took as
guests his three beloved foster-brothers, sons of the
king and queen who had brought him up.
</p>

<p>
After a time Maeldūn happened to be among a
company of young warriors who were contending at
putting the stone in the graveyard of the ruined
church of Doocloone. Maeldūn's foot was planted,
as he heaved the stone, on a scorched and blackened
flagstone; and one who was by, a monk named
Briccne,<note place='foot'><p>
Here we have evidently a reminiscence of Briccriu of the
Poisoned Tongue, the mischief-maker of the Ultonians.
</p></note> said to him: <q>It were better for thee to
avenge the man who was burnt there than to cast
stones over his burnt bones.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who was that?</q> asked Maeldūn.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ailill, thy father,</q> they told him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who slew him?</q> said he.
</p>

<p>
<q>Reavers from Leix,</q> they said, <q>and they destroyed
him on this spot.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Maeldūn threw down the stone he was about
to cast, and put his mantle round him and went home;
and he asked the way to Leix. They told him he could
only go there by sea.<note place='foot'><p>
The Arans are three islands at the entrance of Galway Bay.
They are a perfect museum of mysterious ruins.
</p></note>
</p>

<pb n='312' id='page312'/>

<p>
At the advice of a Druid he then built him a boat,
or coracle, of skins lapped threefold one over the
other; and the wizard also told him that seventeen
men only must accompany him, and on what day he
must begin the boat and on what day he must put out
to sea.
</p>

<p>
So when his company was ready he put out and
hoisted the sail, but had gone only a little way when
his three foster-brothers came down to the beach and
entreated him to take them. <q>Get you home,</q> said
Maeldūn, <q>for none but the number I have may go
with me.</q> But the three youths would not be separated
from Maeldūn, and they flung themselves into the
sea. He turned back, lest they should be drowned,
and brought them into his boat. All, as we shall see,
were punished for this transgression, and Maeldūn condemned
to wandering until expiation had been made.
</p>

<p>
Irish bardic tales excel in their openings. In this
case, as usual, the <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>mise-en-scène</foreign> is admirably contrived.
The narrative which follows tells how, after seeing his
father's slayer on an island, but being unable to land
there, Maeldūn and his party are blown out to sea,
where they visit a great number of islands and have
many strange adventures on them. The tale becomes,
in fact, a <hi rend='italic'>cento</hi> of stories and incidents, some not very
interesting, while in others, as in the adventure of
the Island of the Silver Pillar, or the Island of the
Flaming Rampart, or that where the episode of the
eagle takes place, the Celtic sense of beauty, romance,
and mystery find an expression unsurpassed, perhaps,
in literature.
</p>

<p>
In the following rendering I have omitted the verses
given by Joyce at the end of each adventure. They
merely recapitulate the prose narrative, and are not
found in the earliest manuscript authorities.
</p>

<pb n='313' id='page313'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Slaves</hi>
</p>

<p>
Maeldūn and his crew had rowed all day and half
the night when they came to two small bare islands
with two forts in them, and a noise was heard from
them of armed men quarrelling. <q>Stand off from me,</q>
cried one of them, <q>for I am a better man than thou.
'Twas I slew Ailill of the Edge-of-Battle and burned the
church of Doocloone over him, and no kinsman has
avenged his death on me. And <hi rend='italic'>thou</hi> hast never done
the like of that.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Maeldūn was about to land, and Germān<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Ghermawn</q>&mdash;the <q>G</q> hard.
</p></note> and
Diuran the Rhymer cried that God had guided them
to the spot where they would be. But a great wind
arose suddenly and blew them off into the boundless
ocean, and Maeldūn said to his foster-brothers: <q>Ye
have caused this to be, casting yourselves on board in
spite of the words of the Druid.</q> And they had no
answer, save only to be silent for a little space.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Ants</hi>
</p>

<p>
They drifted three days and three nights, not
knowing whither to row, when at the dawn of the third
day they heard the noise of breakers, and came to an
island as soon as the sun was up. Here, ere they could
land, they met a swarm of ferocious ants, each the size
of a foal, that came down the strand and into the sea
to get at them; so they made off quickly, and saw no
land for three days more.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Great Birds</hi>
</p>

<p>
This was a terraced island, with trees all round it,
and great birds sitting on the trees. Maeldūn landed
first alone, and carefully searched the island for any
<pb n='314' id='page314'/>
evil thing, but finding none, the rest followed him, and
killed and ate many of the birds, bringing others on
board their boat.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Fierce Beast</hi>
</p>

<p>
A great sandy island was this, and on it a beast like
a horse, but with clawed feet like a hound's. He flew
at them to devour them, but they put off in time, and
were pelted by the beast with pebbles from the shore
as they rowed away.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Giant Horses</hi>
</p>

<p>
A great, flat island, which it fell by lot to Germān
and Diuran to explore first. They found a vast green
racecourse, on which were the marks of horses' hoofs,
each as big as the sail of a ship, and the shells of
nuts of monstrous size were lying about, and much
plunder. So they were afraid, and took ship hastily
again, and from the sea they saw a horse-race in progress
and heard the shouting of a great multitude
cheering on the white horse or the brown, and saw the
giant horses running swifter than the wind.<note place='foot'><p>
Horse-racing was a particular delight to the ancient Irish, and
is mentioned in a ninth-century poem in praise of May as one of the
attractions of that month. The name of the month of May given
in an ancient Gaulish calendar means <q>the month of horse-racing.</q>
</p></note> So they
rowed away with all their might, thinking they had
come upon an assembly of demons.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Stone Door</hi>
</p>

<p>
A full week passed, and then they found a great, high
island with a house standing on the shore. A door
with a valve of stone opened into the sea, and through
it the sea-waves kept hurling salmon into the house.
Maeldūn and his party entered, and found the house
<pb n='315' id='page315'/>
empty of folk, but a great bed lay ready for the
chief to whom it belonged, and a bed for each three
of his company, and meat and drink beside each bed.
Maeldūn and his party ate and drank their fill, and
then sailed off again.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Apples</hi>
</p>

<p>
By the time they had come here they had been a
long time voyaging, and food had failed them, and
they were hungry. This island had precipitous sides
from which a wood hung down, and as they passed
along the cliffs Maeldūn broke off a twig and held it
in his hand. Three days and nights they coasted the
cliff and found no entrance to the island, but by that
time a cluster of three apples had grown on the end of
Maeldūn's rod, and each apple sufficed the crew for
forty days.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Wondrous Beast</hi>
</p>

<p>
This island had a fence of stone round it, and within
the fence a huge beast that raced round and round the
island. And anon it went to the top of the island, and
then performed a marvellous feat, viz., it turned its
body round and round inside its skin, the skin remaining
unmoved, while again it would revolve its skin
round and round the body. When it saw the party it
rushed at them, but they escaped, pelted with stones as
they rowed away. One of the stones pierced through
Maeldūn's shield and lodged in the keel of the boat.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Biting Horses</hi>
</p>

<p>
Here were many great beasts resembling horses, that
tore continually pieces of flesh from each other's sides,
so that all the island ran with blood. They rowed
hastily away, and were now disheartened and full of
<pb n='316' id='page316'/>
complaints, for they knew not where they were, nor
how to find guidance or aid in their quest.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Fiery Swine</hi>
</p>

<p>
With great weariness, hunger, and thirst they arrived
at the tenth island, which was full of trees loaded with
golden apples. Under the trees went red beasts, like
fiery swine, that kicked the trees with their legs, when
the apples fell and the beasts consumed them. The
beasts came out at morning only, when a multitude of
birds left the island, and swam out to sea till nones,
when they turned and swam inward again till vespers,
and ate the apples all night.
</p>

<p>
Maeldūn and his comrades landed at night, and felt
the soil hot under their feet from the fiery swine in
their caverns underground. They collected all the
apples they could, which were good both against hunger
and thirst, and loaded their boat with them and put to
sea once more, refreshed.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Little Cat</hi>
</p>

<p>
The apples had failed them when they came hungry and
thirsting to the eleventh island. This was, as it were,
a tall white tower of chalk reaching up to the clouds,
and on the rampart about it were great houses white as
snow. They entered the largest of them, and found
no man in it, but a small cat playing on four stone pillars
which were in the midst of the house, leaping from one
to the other. It looked a little on the Irish warriors,
but did not cease from its play. On the walls of the
houses there were three rows of objects hanging up,
one row of brooches of gold and silver, and one of
neck-torques of gold and silver, each as big as the
hoop of a cask, and one of great swords with gold and
silver hilts. Quilts and shining garments lay in the
<pb n='317' id='page317'/>
room, and there, also, were a roasted ox and a flitch of
bacon and abundance of liquor. <q>Hath this been left
for us?</q> said Maeldūn to the cat. It looked at him
a moment, and then continued its play. So there they
ate and drank and slept, and stored up what remained
of the food. Next day, as they made to leave the
house, the youngest of Maeldūn's foster-brothers took
a necklace from the wall, and was bearing it out when
the cat suddenly <q>leaped through him like a fiery
arrow,</q> and he fell, a heap of ashes, on the floor.
Thereupon Maeldūn, who had forbidden the theft of
the jewel, soothed the cat and replaced the necklace,
and they strewed the ashes of the dead youth on the
sea-shore, and put to sea again.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Black and the White Sheep</hi>
</p>

<p>
This had a brazen palisade dividing it in two, and
a flock of black sheep on one side and of white
sheep on the other. Between them was a big man
who tended the flocks, and sometimes he put a
white sheep among the black, when it became black
at once, or a black sheep among the white, when
it immediately turned white.<note place='foot'><p>
The same phenomenon is recorded as being witnessed by Peredur
in the Welsh tale of that name in the <q>Mabinogion.</q>
</p></note> By way of an experiment
Maeldūn flung a peeled white wand on the side
of the black sheep. It at once turned black, whereat
they left the place in terror, and without landing.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Giant Cattle</hi>
</p>

<p>
A great and wide island with a herd of huge swine
on it. They killed a small pig and roasted it on the
spot, as it was too great to carry on board. The island
rose up into a very high mountain, and Diuran and
Germān went to view the country from the top of it.
<pb n='318' id='page318'/>
On their way they met a broad river. To try the
depth of the water Germān dipped in the haft of
his spear, which at once was consumed as with liquid
fire. On the other bank was a huge man guarding
what seemed a herd of oxen. He called to them not
to disturb the calves, so they went no further and
speedily sailed away.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Mill</hi>
</p>

<p>
Here they found a great and grim-looking mill, and
a giant miller grinding corn in it. <q>Half the corn of
your country,</q> he said, <q>is ground here. Here comes
to be ground all that men begrudge to each other.</q>
Heavy and many were the loads they saw going to it,
and all that was ground in it was carried away westwards.
So they crossed themselves and sailed away.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Black Mourners</hi>
</p>

<p>
An island full of black people continually weeping
and lamenting. One of the two remaining foster-brothers
landed on it, and immediately turned black
and fell to weeping like the rest. Two others went to
fetch him; the same fate befell them. Four others
then went with their heads wrapped in cloths, that
they should not look on the land or breathe the air
of the place, and they seized two of the lost ones and
brought them away perforce, but not the foster-brother.
The two rescued ones could not explain their conduct
except by saying that they had to do as they saw others
doing about them.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Four Fences</hi>
</p>

<p>
Four fences of gold, silver, brass, and crystal divided
this island into four parts, kings in one, queens in
another, warriors in a third, maidens in the fourth.
</p>


<pb n='319' id='page319'/>

<p>
On landing, a maiden gave them food like cheese, that
tasted to each man as he wished it to be, and an
intoxicating liquor that put them asleep for three
days. When they awoke they were at sea in their
boat, and of the island and its inhabitants nothing was
to be seen.
</p>

<p>
The Island of the Glass Bridge
</p>

<p>
Here we come to one of the most elaborately wrought
and picturesque of all the incidents of the voyage. The
island they now reached had on it a fortress with a
brazen door, and a bridge of glass leading to it. When
they sought to cross the bridge it threw them backward.<note place='foot'><p>
Like the bridge to Skatha't dūn, <ref target='page188'>p. 188</ref>.
</p></note>
A woman came out of the fortress with a pail
in her hand, and lifting from the bridge a slab of glass
she let down her pail into the water beneath, and
returned to the fortress. They struck on the brazen
portcullis before them to gain admittance, but the
melody given forth by the smitten metal plunged them
in slumber till the morrow morn. Thrice over this
happened, the woman each time making an ironical
speech about Maeldūn. On the fourth day, however,
she came out to them over the bridge, wearing a white
mantle with a circlet of gold on her hair, two silver
sandals on her rosy feet, and a filmy silken smock next
her skin.
</p>

<p>
<q>My welcome to thee, O Maeldūn,</q> she said, and
she welcomed each man of the crew by his own name.
Then she took them into the great house and allotted
a couch to the chief, and one for each three of his men.
She gave them abundance of food and drink, all out
of her one pail, each man finding in it what he most
desired. When she had departed they asked Maeldūn
if they should woo the maiden for him. <q>How would
<pb n='320' id='page320'/>
it hurt you to speak with her?</q> says Maeldūn. They
do so, and she replies: <q>I know not, nor have ever
known, what sin is.</q> Twice over this is repeated.
<q>To-morrow,</q> she says at last, <q>you shall have your
answer.</q> When the morning breaks, however, they
find themselves once more at sea, with no sign of the
island or fortress or lady.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Shouting Birds</hi>
</p>

<p>
They hear from afar a great cry and chanting, as it
were a singing of psalms, and rowing for a day and
night they come at last to an island full of birds, black,
brown, and speckled, all shouting and speaking. They
sail away without landing.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Anchorite</hi>
</p>

<p>
Here they found a wooded island full of birds, and
on it a solitary man, whose only clothing was his hair.
They asked him of his country and kin. He tells them
that he was a man of Ireland who had put to sea<note place='foot'><p>
Probably we are to understand that he was an anchorite seeking
for an islet on which to dwell in solitude and contemplation. The
western islands of Ireland abound in the ruins of huts and oratories
built by single monks or little communities.
</p></note> with
a sod of his native country under his feet. God had
turned the sod into an island, adding a foot's breadth
to it and one tree for every year. The birds are his
kith and kin, and they all wait there till Doomsday,
miraculously nourished by angels. He entertained
them for three nights, and then they sailed away.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Miraculous Fountain</hi>
</p>

<p>
This island had a golden rampart, and a soft white
soil like down. In it they found another anchorite
clothed only in his hair. There was a fountain in it
<pb n='321' id='page321'/>
which yields whey or water on Fridays and Wednesdays,
milk on Sundays and feasts of martyrs, and ale
and wine on the feasts of Apostles, of Mary, of John
the Baptist, and on the high tides of the year.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Smithy</hi>
</p>

<p>
As they approached this they heard from afar as it
were the clanging of a tremendous smithy, and heard
men talking of themselves. <q>Little boys they seem,</q>
said one, <q>in a little trough yonder.</q> They rowed
hastily away, but did not turn their boat, so as not to
seem to be flying; but after a while a giant smith came
out of the forge holding in his tongs a huge mass of
glowing iron, which he cast after them, and all the sea
boiled round it, as it fell astern of their boat.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Sea of Clear Glass</hi>
</p>

<p>
After that they voyaged until they entered a sea
that resembled green glass. Such was its purity that
the gravel and the sand of the sea were clearly visible
through it; and they saw no monsters or beasts
therein among the crags, but only the pure gravel and
the green sand. For a long space of the day they were
voyaging in that sea, and great was its splendour and
its beauty.<note place='foot'><p>
Tennyson has been particularly happy in his description of
these undersea islands.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Undersea Island</hi>
</p>

<p>
They next found themselves in a sea, thin like mist,
that seemed as if it would not support their boat. In
the depths they saw roofed fortresses, and a fair land
around them. A monstrous beast lodged in a tree there,
with droves of cattle about it, and beneath it an armed
warrior. In spite of the warrior, the beast ever and
<pb n='322' id='page322'/>
anon stretched down a long neck and seized one of
the cattle and devoured it. Much dreading lest they
should sink through that mist-like sea, they sailed over
it and away.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Prophecy</hi>
</p>

<p>
When they arrived here they found the water rising
in high cliffs round the island, and, looking down, saw
on it a crowd of people, who screamed at them, <q>It is
they, it is they,</q> till they were out of breath. Then
came a woman and pelted them from below with large
nuts, which they gathered and took with them. As
they went they heard the folk crying to each other:
<q>Where are they now?</q> <q>They are gone away.</q>
<q>They are not.</q> <q>It is likely,</q> says the tale, <q>that
there was some one concerning whom the islanders
had a prophecy that he would ruin their country and
expel them from their land.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Spouting Water</hi>
</p>

<p>
Here a great stream spouted out of one side of the
island and arched over it like a rainbow, falling on the
strand at the further side. And when they thrust
their spears into the stream above them they brought
out salmon from it as much as they would, and the
island was filled with the stench of those they could
not carry away.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Silvern Column</hi>
</p>

<p>
The next wonder to which they came forms one of
the most striking and imaginative episodes of the
voyage. It was a great silvern column, four-square,
rising from the sea. Each of its four sides was as
wide as two oar-strokes of the boat. Not a sod of
earth was at its foot, but it rose from the boundless
<pb n='323' id='page323'/>
ocean and its summit was lost in the sky. From that
summit a huge silver net was flung far away into the
sea, and through a mesh of that net they sailed. As
they did so Diuran hacked away a piece of the net.
<q>Destroy it not,</q> said Maeldūn, <q>for what we see is
the work of mighty men.</q> Diuran said: <q>For the
praise of God's name I do this, that our tale may be
believed, and if I reach Ireland again this piece of silver
shall be offered by me on the high altar of Armagh.</q>
Two ounces and a half it weighed when it was measured
afterwards in Armagh.
</p>

<p>
<q>And then they heard a voice from the summit of
yonder pillar, mighty, clear, and distinct. But they
knew not the tongue it spake, or the words it uttered.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Pedestal</hi>
</p>

<p>
The next island stood on a foot, or pedestal, which
rose from the sea, and they could find no way of access
to it. In the base of the pedestal was a door, closed
and locked, which they could not open, so they sailed
away, having seen and spoken with no one.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Women</hi>
</p>

<p>
Here they found the rampart of a mighty dūn,
enclosing a mansion. They landed to look on it, and
sat on a hillock near by. Within the dūn they saw
seventeen maidens busy at preparing a great bath. In
a little while a rider, richly clad, came up swiftly on a
racehorse, and lighted down and went inside, one of the
girls taking the horse. The rider then went into the
bath, when they saw that it was a woman. Shortly
after that one of the maidens came out and invited
them to enter, saying: <q>The Queen invites you.</q>
They went into the fort and bathed, and then sat down
to meat, each man with a maiden over against him, and
<pb n='324' id='page324'/>
Maeldūn opposite to the queen. And Maeldūn was
wedded to the queen, and each of the maidens to one
of his men, and at nightfall canopied chambers were
allotted to each of them. On the morrow morn they
made ready to depart, but the queen would not have
them go, and said: <q>Stay here, and old age will never
fall on you, but ye shall remain as ye are now for
ever and ever, and what ye had last night ye shall have
always. And be no longer a-wandering from island to
island on the ocean.</q>
</p>

<p>
She then told Maeldūn that she was the mother
of the seventeen girls they had seen, and her husband
had been king of the island. He was now dead, and
she reigned in his place. Each day she went into the
great plain in the interior of the island to judge the
folk, and returned to the dūn at night.
</p>

<p>
So they remained there for three months of winter;
but at the end of that time it seemed they had been
there three years, and the men wearied of it, and longed
to set forth for their own country.
</p>

<p>
<q>What shall we find there,</q> said Maeldūn, <q>that is
better than this?</q>
</p>

<p>
But still the people murmured and complained, and
at last they said: <q>Great is the love which Maeldūn has
for his woman. Let him stay with her alone if he will,
but we will go to our own country.</q> But Maeldūn
would not be left after them, and at last one day, when
the queen was away judging the folk, they went on
board their bark and put out to sea. Before they had
gone far, however, the queen came riding up with a
clew of twine in her hand, and she flung it after them.
Maeldūn caught it in his hand, and it clung to his hand
so that he could not free himself, and the queen, holding
the other end, drew them back to land. And they
stayed on the island another three months.
</p>

<pb n='325' id='page325'/>

<p>
Twice again the same thing happened, and at last
the people averred that Maeldūn held the clew on
purpose, so great was his love for the woman. So the
next time another man caught the clew, but it clung to
his hand as before; so Diuran smote off his hand, and
it fell with the clew into the sea. <q>When she saw that
she at once began to wail and shriek, so that all the land
was one cry, wailing and shrieking.</q> And thus they
escaped from the Island of the Women.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Red Berries</hi>
</p>

<p>
On this island were trees with great red berries
which yielded an intoxicating and slumbrous juice.
They mingled it with water to moderate its power,
and filled their casks with it, and sailed away.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Eagle</hi>
</p>

<p>
A large island, with woods of oak and yew on one
side of it, and on the other a plain, whereon were
herds of sheep, and a little lake in it; and there also
they found a small church and a fort, and an ancient
grey cleric, clad only in his hair. Maeldūn asked him
who he was.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am the fifteenth man of the monks of St. Brennan
of Birr,</q> he said. <q>We went on our pilgrimage into
the ocean, and they have all died save me alone.</q> He
showed them the tablet (? calendar) of the Holy Brennan,
and they prostrated themselves before it, and Maeldūn
kissed it. They stayed there for a season, feeding on
the sheep of the island.
</p>

<p>
One day they saw what seemed to be a cloud coming
up from the south-west. As it drew near, however,
they saw the waving of pinions, and <corr sic='p rceived'>perceived</corr> that it
was an enormous bird. It came into the island, and,
alighting very wearily on a hill near the lake, it began
<pb n='326' id='page326'/>
eating the red berries, like grapes, which grew on a
huge tree-branch as big as a full-grown oak, that it had
brought with it, and the juice and fragments of the
berries fell into the lake, reddening all the water.
Fearful that it would seize them in its talons and bear
them out to sea, they lay hid in the woods and watched
it. After a while, however, Maeldūn went out to the
foot of the hill, but the bird did him no harm, and then
the rest followed cautiously behind their shields, and
one of them gathered the berries off the branch which
the bird held in its talons, but it did them no evil, and
regarded them not at all. And they saw that it was
very old, and its plumage dull and decayed.
</p>

<p>
At the hour of noon two eagles came up from the
south-west and alit in front of the great bird, and after
resting awhile they set to work picking off the insects
that infested its jaws and eyes and ears. This they
continued till vespers, when all three ate of the berries
again. At last, on the following day, when the great
bird had been completely cleansed, it plunged into the
lake, and again the two eagles picked and cleansed it.
Till the third day the great bird remained preening and
shaking its pinions, and its feathers became glossy and
abundant, and then, soaring upwards, it flew thrice
round the island, and away to the quarter whence it had
come, and its flight was now swift and strong; whence
it was manifest to them that this had been its renewal
from old age to youth, according as the prophet said,
<hi rend='italic'>Thy youth is renewed like the eagle's</hi>.<note place='foot'><p>
Ps. ciii. 5.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Then Diuran said: <q>Let us bathe in that lake and
renew ourselves where the bird hath been renewed.</q>
<q>Nay,</q> said another, <q>for the bird hath left his venom
in it.</q> But Diuran plunged in and drank of the water.
From that time so long as he lived his eyes were strong
<pb n='327' id='page327'/>
and keen, and not a tooth fell from his jaw nor a hair
from his head, and he never knew illness or infirmity.
</p>

<p>
Thereafter they bade farewell to the anchorite, and
fared forth on the ocean once more.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Laughing Folk</hi>
</p>

<p>
Here they found a great company of men laughing
and playing incessantly. They drew lots as to who should
enter and explore it, and it fell to Maeldūn's foster-brother.
But when he set foot on it he at once began
to laugh and play with the others, and could not leave
off, nor would he come back to his comrades. So they
left him and sailed away.<note place='foot'><p>
This disposes of the last of the foster-brothers, who should not
have joined the party.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Flaming Rampart</hi>
</p>

<p>
They now came in sight of an island which was not
large, and it had about it a rampart of flame that
circled round and round it continually. In one part of
the rampart there was an opening, and when this opening
came opposite to them they saw through it the
whole island, and saw those who dwelt therein, even
men and women, beautiful, many, and wearing adorned
garments, with vessels of gold in their hands. And
the festal music which they made came to the ears of
the wanderers. For a long time they lingered there,
watching this marvel, <q>and they deemed it delightful
to behold.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Monk of Tory</hi>
</p>

<p>
Far off among the waves they saw what they took to
be a white bird on the water. Drawing near to it they
found it to be an aged man clad only in the white hair
<pb n='328' id='page328'/>
of his body, and he was throwing himself in prostrations
on a broad rock.
</p>

<p>
<q>From Torach<note place='foot'><p>
Tory Island, off the Donegal coast. There was there a monastery
and a church dedicated to St. Columba.
</p></note> I have come hither,</q> he said, <q rend='post: none'>and
there I was reared. I was cook in the monastery there,
and the food of the Church I used to sell for myself,
so that I had at last much treasure of raiment and
brazen vessels and gold-bound books and all that man
desires. Great was my pride and arrogance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>One day as I dug a grave in which to bury a churl
who had been brought on to the island, a voice came from
below where a holy man lay buried, and he said: <q>Put
not the corpse of a sinner on me, a holy, pious person!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
After a dispute the monk buried the corpse elsewhere,
and was promised an eternal reward for doing so. Not
long thereafter he put to sea in a boat with all his
accumulated treasures, meaning apparently to escape
from the island with his plunder. A great wind blew
him far out to sea, and when he was out of sight of
land the boat stood still in one place. He saw near
him a man (angel) sitting on the wave. <q>Whither
goest thou?</q> said the man. <q>On a pleasant way,
whither I am now looking,</q> said the monk. <q>It would
not be pleasant to thee if thou knewest what is around
thee,</q> said the man. <q>So far as eye can see there is
one crowd of demons all gathered around thee, because
of thy covetousness and pride, and theft, and other
evil deeds. Thy boat hath stopped, nor will it move
until thou do my will, and the fires of hell shall get
hold of thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
He came near to the boat, and laid his hand on the
arm of the fugitive, who promised to do his will.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fling into the sea,</q> he said, <q>all the wealth that is
in thy boat.</q>
</p>

<pb n='329' id='page329'/>

<p>
<q>It is a pity,</q> said the monk, <q>that it should go to
loss.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It shall in nowise go to loss. There will be one
man whom thou wilt profit.</q>
</p>

<p>
The monk thereupon flung everything into the sea
save one little wooden cup, and he cast away oars and
rudder. The man gave him a provision of whey and
seven cakes, and bade him abide wherever his boat should
stop. The wind and waves carried him hither and
thither till at last the boat came to rest upon the rock
where the wanderers found him. There was nothing
there but the bare rock, but remembering what he was
bidden he stepped out upon a little ledge over which
the waves washed, and the boat immediately left him,
and the rock was enlarged for him. There he remained
seven years, nourished by otters which brought him
salmon out of the sea, and even flaming firewood on
which to cook them, and his cup was filled with good
liquor every day. <q>And neither wet nor heat nor
cold affects me in this place.</q>
</p>

<p>
At the noon hour miraculous nourishment was
brought for the whole crew, and thereafter the ancient
man said to them:
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye will all reach your country, and the man that
slew thy father, O Maeldūn, ye will find him in a fortress
before you. And slay him not, but forgive him;
because God hath saved you from manifold great perils,
and ye too are men deserving of death.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then they bade him farewell and went on their
accustomed way.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Island of the Falcon</hi>
</p>

<p>
This is uninhabited save for herds of sheep and oxen.
They land on it and eat their fill, and one of them
sees there a large falcon. <q>This falcon,</q> he says, <q>is
<pb n='330' id='page330'/>
like the falcons of Ireland.</q> <q>Watch it,</q> says Maeldūn,
<q>and see how it will go from us.</q> It flew off to
the south-east, and they rowed after it all day till
vespers.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Home-coming</hi>
</p>

<p>
At nightfall they sighted a land like Ireland; and
soon came to a small island, where they ran their prow
ashore. It was the island where dwelt the man who
had slain Ailill.
</p>

<p>
They went up to the dūn that was on the island,
and heard men talking within it as they sat at meat.
One man said:
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be ill for us if we saw Maeldūn now.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That Maeldūn has been drowned,</q> said another.
</p>

<p>
<q>Maybe it is he who shall waken you from sleep
to-night,</q> said a third.
</p>

<p>
<q>If he should come now,</q> said a fourth, <q>what
should we do?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not hard to answer that,</q> said the chief of them.
<q>Great welcome should he have if he were to come,
for he hath been a long space in great tribulation.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Maeldūn smote with the wooden clapper
against the door. <q>Who is there?</q> asked the doorkeeper.
</p>

<p>
<q>Maeldūn is here,</q> said he.
</p>

<p>
They entered the house in peace, and great welcome
was made for them, and they were arrayed in new
garments. And then they told the story of all the
marvels that God had shown them, according to the
words of the <q>sacred poet,</q> who said, <hi rend='italic'>Haec olim
meminisse juvabit.</hi><note place='foot'><p>
<q>One day we shall delight in the remembrance of these things.</q>
The quotation is from Vergil, <q>Æn.</q> i. 203  <q>Sacred poet</q> is a
translation of the <hi rend='italic'>vates sacer</hi> of Horace.
</p></note>
</p>

<pb n='331' id='page331'/>

<p>
Then Maeldūn went to his own home and kindred,
and Diuran the Rhymer took with him the piece of
silver that he had hewn from the net of the pillar, and
laid it on the high altar of Armagh in triumph and
exultation at the miracles that God had wrought for
them. And they told again the story of all that had
befallen them, and all the marvels they had seen by
sea and land, and the perils they had endured.
</p>

<p>
The story ends with the following words:
</p>

<p>
<q>Now Aed the Fair [Aed Finn<note place='foot'><p>
This sage and poet has not been identified from any other
record. Praise and thanks to him, whoever he may have been.

Ireland, arranged this story as it standeth here; and he
did so for a delight to the mind, and for the folks of
Ireland after him.</q>

<head>CHAPTER VIII: MYTHS AND TALES
OF THE CYMRY</head>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Bardic Philosophy</hi>
</p>

<p>
The absence in early Celtic literature of any
world-myth, or any philosophic account of the
origin and constitution of things, was noticed
at the opening of our third chapter. In Gaelic literature
there is, as far as I know, nothing which even
pretends to represent early Celtic thought on this
subject. It is otherwise in Wales. Here there has
existed for a considerable time a body of teaching
purporting to contain a portion, at any rate, of that
ancient Druidic thought which, as Caesar tells us, was
communicated only to the initiated, and never written
down. This teaching is principally to be found in two
volumes entitled <q>Barddas,</q> a compilation made from
materials in his possession by a Welsh bard and scholar
named Llewellyn Sion, of Glamorgan, towards the end
of the sixteenth century, and edited, with a translation,
by J.A. Williams ap Ithel for the Welsh MS. Society.
Modern Celtic scholars pour contempt on the pretensions
of works like this to enshrine any really
antique thought. Thus Mr. Ivor B. John: <q>All idea
of a bardic esoteric doctrine involving pre-Christian
mythic philosophy must be utterly discarded.</q> And
again: <q>The nonsense talked upon the subject is
largely due to the uncritical invention of pseudo-antiquaries
of the sixteenth to seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>The Mabinogion,</q> pp. <ref target='page45'>45</ref> and <ref target='page54'>54</ref>.
</p></note> Still the bardic Order was
certainly at one time in possession of such a doctrine.
That Order had a fairly continuous existence in Wales.
And though no critical thinker would build with any
<pb n='333' id='page333'/>
confidence a theory of pre-Christian doctrine on a
document of the sixteenth century, it does not seem
wise to scout altogether the possibility that some
fragments of antique lore may have lingered even so
late as that in bardic tradition.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, <q>Barddas</q> is a work of considerable
philosophic interest, and even if it represents nothing
but a certain current of Cymric thought in the sixteenth
century it is not unworthy of attention by the student
of things Celtic. Purely Druidic it does not even
profess to be, for Christian personages and episodes
from Christian history figure largely in it. But we
come occasionally upon a strain of thought which,
whatever else it may be, is certainly not Christian, and
speaks of an independent philosophic system.
</p>

<p>
In this system two primary existences are contemplated,
God and Cythrawl, who stand respectively for
the principle of energy tending towards life, and the
principle of destruction tending towards nothingness.
Cythrawl is realised in Annwn,<note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Annoon.</q> It was the word used in the early
literature for Hades or Fairyland.
</p></note> which may be rendered,
the Abyss, or Chaos. In the beginning there was
nothing but God and Annwn. Organised life began
by the Word&mdash;God pronounced His ineffable Name
and the <q>Manred</q> was formed. The Manred was
the primal substance of the universe. It was conceived
as a multitude of minute indivisible particles&mdash;atoms,
in fact&mdash;each being a microcosm, for God is complete
in each of them, while at the same time each is a part
of God, the Whole. The totality of being as it now
exists is represented by three concentric circles. The
innermost of them, where life sprang from Annwn, is
called <q>Abred,</q> and is the stage of struggle and evolution&mdash;the
contest of life with Cythrawl. The next is
<pb n='334' id='page334'/>
the circle of <q>Gwynfyd,</q> or Purity, in which life is
manifested as a pure, rejoicing force, having attained
its triumph over evil. The last and outermost circle is
called <q>Ceugant,</q> or Infinity. Here all predicates fail
us, and this circle, represented graphically not by a
bounding line, but by divergent rays, is inhabited by
<!--<figure url='images/ill-337.png' rend='text-align: center; page-float: "htb"'><head>The Circles of Being</head></figure>-->
God alone. The following extract from <q>Barddas,</q>
in which the alleged bardic teaching is conveyed in
catechism form, will serve to show the order of ideas in
which the writer's mind moved:

obtained without seeing and knowing everything, but
it is not possible to see or to know everything without
suffering everything.... And there can be no full

<p>
There is much here that reminds us of Gnostic or
Oriental thought. It is certainly very unlike Christian
orthodoxy of the sixteenth century. As a product of
the Cymric mind of that period the reader may take it
for what it is worth, without troubling himself either
with antiquarian theories or with their refutations.
</p>

<p>
Let us now turn to the really ancient work, which
is not philosophic, but creative and imaginative, produced
by British bards and fabulists of the Middle
Ages. But before we go on to set forth what we
shall find in this literature we must delay a moment to
discuss one thing which we shall not.
</p>

<pb n='336' id='page336'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Arthurian Saga</hi>
</p>

<p>
For the majority of modern readers who have not
made any special study of the subject, the mention of
early British legend will inevitably call up the glories
of the Arthurian Saga&mdash;they will think of the fabled
palace at Caerleon-on-Usk, the Knights of the Round
Table riding forth on chivalrous adventure, the Quest
of the Grail, the guilty love of Lancelot, flower of
knighthood, for the queen, the last great battle by the
northern sea, the voyage of Arthur, sorely wounded,
but immortal, to the mystic valley of Avalon. But as
a matter of fact they will find in the native literature
of medi&aelig;val Wales little or nothing of all this&mdash;no
Round Table, no Lancelot, no Grail-Quest, no Isle of
Avalon, until the Welsh learned about them from
abroad; and though there was indeed an Arthur in this
literature, he is a wholly different being from the
Arthur of what we now call the Arthurian Saga.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Nennius</hi>
</p>

<p>
The earliest extant mention of Arthur is to be found in
the work of the British historian Nennius, who wrote his
<q>Historia Britonum</q> about the year 800. He derives
his authority from various sources&mdash;ancient monuments
and writings of Britain and of Ireland (in connexion
with the latter country he records the legend of Partholan),
Roman annals, and chronicles of saints, especially
St. Germanus. He presents a fantastically Romanised
and Christianised view of British history, deriving the
Britons from a Trojan and Roman ancestry. His
account of Arthur, however, is both sober and brief.
Arthur, who, according to Nennius, lived in the sixth
century, was not a king; his ancestry was less noble
than that of many other British chiefs, who, nevertheless,
<pb n='337' id='page337'/>
for his great talents as a military <hi rend='italic'>Imperator</hi>, or <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>dux
bellorum</foreign>, chose him for their leader against the Saxons,
whom he defeated in twelve battles, the last being at
Mount Badon. Arthur's office was doubtless a relic of
Roman military organisation, and there is no reason to
doubt his historical existence, however impenetrable
may be the veil which now obscures his valiant and
often triumphant battlings for order and civilisation in
that disastrous age.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Geoffrey of Monmouth</hi>
</p>

<p>
Next we have Geoffrey of Monmouth, Bishop of St.
Asaph, who wrote his <q>Historia Regum Britani&aelig;</q> in
South Wales in the early part of the twelfth century.
This work is an audacious attempt to make sober
history out of a mass of mythical or legendary matter
mainly derived, if we are to believe the author, from an
ancient book brought by his uncle Walter, Archdeacon
of Oxford, from Brittany. The mention of Brittany
in this connexion is, as we shall see, very significant.
Geoffrey wrote expressly to commemorate the exploits
of Arthur, who now appears as a king, son of Uther
Pendragon and of Igerna, wife of Gorlois, Duke of
Cornwall, to whom Uther gained access in the shape of
her husband through the magic arts of Merlin. He
places the beginning of Arthur's reign in the year 505,
recounts his wars against the Saxons, and says he ultimately
conquered not only all Britain, but Ireland,
Norway, Gaul, and Dacia, and successfully resisted a
demand for tribute and homage from the Romans.
He held his court at Caerleon-on-Usk. While he was
away on the Continent carrying on his struggle with
Rome his nephew Modred usurped his crown and
wedded his wife Guanhumara. Arthur, on this, returned,
and after defeating the traitor at Winchester slew
<pb n='338' id='page338'/>
him in a last battle in Cornwall, where Arthur himself
was sorely wounded (A.D. 542). The queen retired
to a convent at Caerleon. Before his death Arthur
conferred his kingdom on his kinsman Constantine, and
was then carried off mysteriously to <q>the isle of Avalon</q>
to be cured, and <q>the rest is silence.</q> Arthur's magic
sword <q>Caliburn</q> (Welsh <hi rend='italic'>Caladvwlch</hi>; see <ref target='page224'>p. 224</ref>, note)
is mentioned by Geoffrey and described as having been
made in Avalon, a word which seems to imply some
kind of fairyland, a Land of the Dead, and may be
related to the Norse <hi rend='italic'>Valhall</hi>. It was not until later times
that Avalon came to be identified with an actual site in
Britain (Glastonbury). In Geoffrey's narrative there is
nothing about the Holy Grail, or Lancelot, or the
Round Table, and except for the allusion to Avalon the
mystical element of the Arthurian saga is absent. Like
Nennius, Geoffrey finds a fantastic classical origin for
the Britons. His so-called history is perfectly worthless
as a record of fact, but it has proved a veritable
mine for poets and chroniclers, and has the distinction
of having furnished the subject for the earliest English
tragic drama, <q>Gorboduc,</q> as well as for Shakespeare's
<q>King Lear</q>; and its author may be described as the
father&mdash;at least on its quasi-historical side&mdash;of the
Arthurian saga, which he made up partly out of records
of the historical <hi rend='italic'>dux bellorum</hi> of Nennius and partly out
of poetical amplifications of these records made in
Brittany by the descendants of exiles from Wales, many
of whom fled there at the very time when Arthur was
waging his wars against the heathen Saxons. Geoffrey's
book had a wonderful success. It was speedily translated
into French by Wace, who wrote <q>Li Romans
de Brut</q> about 1155, with added details from Breton
sources, and translated from Wace's French into Anglo-Saxon
by Layamon, who thus anticipated Malory's
<pb n='339' id='page339'/>
adaptations of late French prose romances. Except a
few scholars who protested unavailingly, no one doubted
its strict historical truth, and it had the important effect
of giving to early British history a new dignity in the
estimation of Continental and of English princes. To
sit upon the throne of Arthur was regarded as in itself
a glory by Plantagenet monarchs who had not a trace
of Arthur's or of any British blood.

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Saga in Brittany: Marie de France</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Breton sources must next be considered. Unfortunately,
not a line of ancient Breton literature has
come down to us, and for our knowledge of it we must
rely on the appearances it makes in the work of French
writers. One of the earliest of these is the Anglo-Norman
poetess who called herself Marie de France,
and who wrote about 1150 and afterwards. She wrote,
among other things, a number of <q>Lais,</q> or tales,
which she explicitly and repeatedly tells us were translated
or adapted from Breton sources. Sometimes she
claims to have rendered a writer's original exactly:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Les contes que jo sai verais</q></l>
<l>Dunt li Bretun unt fait les lais</l>
<l>Vos conterai assez briefment;</l>
<l>Et cief [sauf] di cest coumencement</l>
<l><q rend='pre: none'>Selunc la lettre è l'escriture.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Little is actually said about Arthur in these tales, but
the events of them are placed in his time&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>en cel tems
tint Artus la terre</hi>&mdash;and the allusions, which include a
mention of the Round Table, evidently imply a general
knowledge of the subject among those to whom these
Breton <q>Lais</q> were addressed. Lancelot is not mentioned,
but there is a <q>Lai</q> about one Lanval, who is
beloved by Arthur's queen, but rejects her because he
has a fairy mistress in the <q>isle d'Avalon.</q> Gawain is
<pb n='340' id='page340'/>
mentioned, and an episode is told in the <q>Lai de
Chevrefoil</q> about Tristan and Iseult, whose maid,
<q>Brangien,</q> is referred to in a way which assumes that
the audience knew the part she had played on Iseult's
bridal night. In short, we have evidence here of the
existence in Brittany of a well-diffused and well-developed
body of chivalric legend gathered about the
personality of Arthur. The legends are so well known
that mere allusions to characters and episodes in them
are as well understood as references to Tennyson's
<q>Idylls</q> would be among us to-day. The <q>Lais</q> of
Marie de France therefore point strongly to Brittany as
the true cradle of the Arthurian saga, on its chivalrous and
romantic side. They do not, however, mention the Grail.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Chrestien de Troyes</hi>
</p>

<p>
Lastly, and chiefly, we have the work of the French
poet Chrestien de Troyes, who began in 1165 to translate
Breton <q>Lais,</q> like Marie de France, and who
practically brought the Arthurian saga into the poetic
literature of Europe, and gave it its main outline and
character. He wrote a <q>Tristan</q> (now lost). He (if
not Walter Map) introduced Lancelot of the Lake into
the story; he wrote a <hi rend='italic'>Conte del Graal</hi>, in which the
Grail legend and Perceval make their first appearance,
though he left the story unfinished, and does not tell
us what the <q>Grail</q> really was.<note place='foot'><p>
Strange as it may seem to us, the character of this object was
by no means fixed from the beginning. In the poem of Wolfram
von Eschenbach it is a stone endowed with magical properties.
The word is derived by the early fabulists from <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>gréable</foreign>, something
pleasant to possess and enjoy, and out of which one could have
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à son gré</foreign>, whatever he chose of good things. The Grail legend will
be dealt with later in connexion with the Welsh tale <q>Peredur.</q>
</p></note> He also wrote a long
<hi rend='italic'>conte d'aventure</hi> entitled <q>Erec,</q> containing the story
of Geraint and Enid. These are the earliest poems
<pb n='341' id='page341'/>
we possess in which the Arthur of chivalric legend
comes prominently forward. What were the sources of
Chrestien? No doubt they were largely Breton. Troyes
is in Champagne, which had been united to Blois in 1019
by Eudes, Count of Blois, and reunited again after a
period of dispossession by Count Theobald de Blois in
1128. Marie, Countess of Champagne, was Chrestien's
patroness. And there were close connexions between
the ruling princes of Blois and of Brittany. Alain II., a
Duke of Brittany, had in the tenth century married a
sister of the Count de Blois, and in the first quarter
of the thirteenth century Jean I. of Brittany married
Blanche de Champagne, while their daughter Alix
married Jean de Chastillon, Count of Blois, in 1254.
It is highly probable, therefore, that through minstrels
who attended their Breton lords at the court of Blois,
from the middle of the tenth century onward, a great
many Breton <q>Lais</q> and legends found their way into
French literature during the eleventh, twelfth, and
thirteenth centuries. But it is also certain that the
Breton legends themselves had been strongly affected
by French influences, and that to the <hi rend='italic'>Matière de France</hi>,
as it was called by medi&aelig;val writers<note place='foot'><p>
Distinguished by these from the other great storehouse of
poetic legend, the <hi rend='italic'>Matière de Bretagne&mdash;i.e.</hi>, the Arthurian saga.
</p></note>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the legends
of Charlemagne and his Paladins&mdash;we owe the Table
Round and the chivalric institutions ascribed to Arthur's
court at Caerleon-on-Usk.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Bleheris</hi>
</p>

<p>
It must not be forgotten that (as Miss Jessie
L. Weston has emphasised in her invaluable
studies on the Arthurian saga) Gautier de Denain,
the earliest of the continuators or re-workers of
Chrestien de Troyes, mentions as his authority for
<pb n='342' id='page342'/>
stories of Gawain one Bleheris, a poet <q>born and
bred in Wales.</q> This forgotten bard is believed to
be identical with <hi rend='italic'>famosus ille fabulator, Bledhericus,</hi>
mentioned by Giraldus Cambrensis, and with the
Bréris quoted by Thomas of Brittany as an authority
for the Tristan story.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Conclusion as to the Origin of the Arthurian Saga</hi>
</p>

<p>
In the absence, however, of any information as to
when, or exactly what, Bleheris wrote, the opinion
must, I think, hold the field that the Arthurian saga,
as we have it now, is not of Welsh, nor even of pure
Breton origin. The Welsh exiles who colonised part
of Brittany about the sixth century must have brought
with them many stories of the historical Arthur. They
must also have brought legends of the Celtic deity
Artaius, a god to whom altars have been found in
France. These personages ultimately blended into one,
even as in Ireland the Christian St. Brigit blended with
the pagan goddess Brigindo.<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page103'>p. 103</ref>.
</p></note> We thus get a mythical
figure combining something of the exaltation of a god
with a definite habitation on earth and a place in history.
An Arthur saga thus arose, which in its Breton (though
not its Welsh) form was greatly enriched by material
drawn in from the legends of Charlemagne and his
peers, while both in Brittany and in Wales it became
a centre round which clustered a mass of floating
legendary matter relating to various Celtic personages,
human and divine. Chrestien de Troyes, working on
Breton material, ultimately gave it the form in which
it conquered the world, and in which it became in the
twelfth and the thirteenth centuries what the Faust
legend was in later times, the accepted vehicle for the
ideals and aspirations of an epoch.
</p>

<pb n='343' id='page343'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Saga in Wales</hi>
</p>

<p>
From the Continent, and especially from Brittany, the
story of Arthur came back into Wales transformed and
glorified. The late Dr. Heinrich Zimmer, in one of
his luminous studies of the subject, remarks that <q>In
Welsh literature we have definite evidence that the
South-Welsh prince, Rhys ap Tewdwr, who had been
in Brittany, brought from thence in the year 1070 the
knowledge of Arthur's Round Table to Wales, where
of course it had been hitherto unknown.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Cultur der Gegenwart,</q> i. ix.
</p></note> And many
Breton lords are known to have followed the banner of
William the Conqueror into England.<note place='foot'><p>
A list of them is given in Lobineau's <q>Histoire de Bretagne.</q>
</p></note> The introducers
of the saga into Wales found, however, a considerable
body of Arthurian matter of a very different character
already in existence there. Besides the traditions of the
historical Arthur, the <hi rend='italic'>dux bellorum</hi> of Nennius, there was
the Celtic deity, Artaius. It is probably a reminiscence of
this deity whom we meet with under the name of Arthur
in the only genuine Welsh Arthurian story we possess,
the story of Kilhwch and Olwen in the <q>Mabinogion.</q>
Much of the Arthurian saga derived from Chrestien and
other Continental writers was translated and adapted in
Wales as in other European countries, but as a matter
of fact it made a later and a lesser impression in Wales
than almost anywhere else. It conflicted with existing
Welsh traditions, both historical and mythological; it
was full of matter entirely foreign to the Welsh spirit,
and it remained always in Wales something alien and
unassimilated. Into Ireland it never entered at all.
</p>

<p>
These few introductory remarks do not, of course,
profess to contain a discussion of the Arthurian saga&mdash;a
vast subject with myriad ramifications, historical,
<pb n='344' id='page344'/>
mythological, mystical, and what not&mdash;but are merely
intended to indicate the relation of that saga to genuine
Celtic literature and to explain why we shall hear so
little of it in the following accounts of Cymric myths
and legends. It was a great spiritual myth which,
arising from the composite source above described,
overran all the Continent, as its hero was supposed
to have done in armed conquest, but it cannot be
regarded as a special possession of the Celtic race,
nor is it at present extant, except in the form of
translation or adaptation, in any Celtic tongue.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Gaelic and Cymric Legend Compared</hi>
</p>

<p>
The myths and legends of the Celtic race which have
come down to us in the Welsh language are in some
respects of a different character from those which we
possess in Gaelic. The Welsh material is nothing like
as full as the Gaelic, nor so early. The tales of the
<q>Mabinogion</q> are mainly drawn from the fourteenth-century
manuscript entitled <q>The Red Book of Hergest.</q>
One of them, the romance of Taliesin, came
from another source, a manuscript of the seventeenth
century. The four oldest tales in the <q>Mabinogion</q>
are supposed by scholars to have taken their present
shape in the tenth or eleventh century, while several
Irish tales, like the story of Etain and Midir or the
Death of Conary, go back to the seventh or eighth.
It will be remembered that the story of the invasion of
Partholan was known to Nennius, who wrote about
the year 800. As one might therefore expect, the
mythological elements in the Welsh romances are
usually much more confused and harder to decipher than
in the earlier of the Irish tales. The mythic interest
has grown less, the story interest greater; the object
of the bard is less to hand down a sacred text than to
<pb n='345' id='page345'/>
entertain a prince's court. We must remember also
that the influence of the Continental romances of
chivalry is clearly perceptible in the Welsh tales; and,
in fact, comes eventually to govern them completely.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Gaelic and Continental Romance</hi>
</p>

<p>
In many respects the Irish Celt anticipated the ideas
of these romances. The lofty courtesy shown to each
other by enemies,<note place='foot'><p>
See, <hi rend='italic'>e.g.,</hi> pp. <ref target='page243'>243</ref> and <ref target='p218n1'>218, <hi rend='italic'>note</hi></ref>.
</p></note> the fantastic pride which forbade a
warrior to take advantage of a wounded adversary,<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page233'>p. 233</ref>, and a similar case in the author's <q>High Deeds of
Finn,</q> p. 82.
</p></note> the
extreme punctilio with which the duties or observances
proper to each man's caste or station were observed<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page232'>p. 232</ref>, and the tale of the recovery of the <q>Tain,</q> <ref target='page234'>p. 234</ref>.
</p></note>&mdash;all
this tone of thought and feeling which would seem
so strange to us if we met an instance of it in classical
literature would seem quite familiar and natural in
Continental romances of the twelfth and later centuries.
Centuries earlier than that it was a marked feature in
Gaelic literature. Yet in the Irish romances, whether
Ultonian or Ossianic, the element which has since been
considered the most essential motive in a romantic tale
is almost entirely lacking. This is the element of love,
or rather of woman-worship. The Continental fabulist
felt that he could do nothing without this motive of
action. But the <q>lady-love</q> of the English, French,
or German knight, whose favour he wore, for whose
grace he endured infinite hardship and peril, does not
meet us in Gaelic literature. It would have seemed
absurd to the Irish Celt to make the plot of a serious
story hinge on the kind of passion with which the
mediaeval Dulcinea inspired her faithful knight. In
the two most famous and popular of Gaelic love-tales,
<pb n='346' id='page346'/>
the tale of Deirdre and <q>The Pursuit of Dermot and
Grania,</q> the women are the wooers, and the men are
most reluctant to commit what they know to be the
folly of yielding to them. Now this romantic, chivalric
kind of love, which idealised woman into a goddess, and
made the service of his lady a sacred duty to the knight,
though it never reached in Wales the height which it
did in Continental and English romances, is yet clearly
discernible there. We can trace it in <q>Kilhwch and
Olwen,</q> which is comparatively an ancient tale. It is
well developed in later stories like <q>Peredur</q> and
<q>The Lady of the Fountain.</q> It is a symptom of the
extent to which, in comparison with the Irish, Welsh
literature had lost its pure Celtic strain and become
affected&mdash;I do not, of course, say to its loss&mdash;by foreign
influences.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Gaelic and Cymric Mythology: Nudd</hi>
</p>

<p>
The oldest of the Welsh tales, those called <q>The
Four Branches of the Mabinogi,</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Pwyll King of Dyfed,</q> <q>Bran and Branwen,</q> <q>Math Sor
of Māthonwy,</q> and <q>Manawyddan Son of Llyr.</q>
</p></note> are the richest in
mythological elements, but these occur in more or less
recognisable form throughout nearly all the mediaeval
tales, and even, after many transmutations, in Malory.
We can clearly discern certain mythological figures
common to all Celtica. We meet, for instance, a
personage called Nudd or Lludd, evidently a solar
deity. A temple dating from Roman times, and
dedicated to him under the name of Nodens, has been
discovered at Lydney, by the Severn. On a bronze
plaque found near the spot is a representation of the
god. He is encircled by a halo and accompanied by
flying spirits and by Tritons. We are reminded of
the Danaan deities and their close connexion with the
<pb n='347' id='page347'/>
sea; and when we find that in Welsh legend an epithet
is attached to Nudd, meaning <q>of the Silver Hand</q>
(though no extant Welsh legend tells the meaning of
the epithet), we have no difficulty in identifying this
Nudd with Nuada of the Silver Hand, who led the
Danaans in the battle of Moytura.<note place='foot'><p>
See <ref target='page107'>p. 107</ref>.
</p></note> Under his name
Lludd he is said to have had a temple on the site of
St. Paul's in London, the entrance to which, according
to Geoffrey of Monmouth, was called in the British
tongue <hi rend='italic'>Parth Lludd</hi>, which the Saxons translated <hi rend='italic'>Ludes
Geat</hi>, our present Ludgate.

</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Llyr and Manawyddan</hi>
</p>

<p>
Again, when we find a mythological personage named
Llyr, with a son named Manawyddan, playing a prominent
part in Welsh legend, we may safely connect them
with the Irish Lir and his son Mananan, gods of the
sea. Llyr-cester, now Leicester, was a centre of the
worship of Llyr.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Llew Llaw Gyffes</hi>
</p>

<p>
Finally, we may point to a character in the
<q>Mabinogi,</q> or tale, entitled <q>Māth Son of Māthonwy.</q>
The name of this character is given as Llew Llaw
Gyffes, which the Welsh fabulist interprets as <q>The
Lion of the Sure Hand,</q> and a tale, which we shall
recount later on, is told to account for the name. But
when we find that this hero exhibits characteristics which
point to his being a solar deity, such as an amazingly
rapid growth from childhood into manhood, and when
we are told, moreover, by Professor Rhys that Gyffes
originally meant, not <q>steady</q> or <q>sure,</q> but <q>long,</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Hibbert Lectures,</q> pp. 237-240.
</p></note>
it becomes evident that we have here a dim and broken
reminiscence of the deity whom the Gaels called Lugh
<pb n='348' id='page348'/>
of the Long Arm,<note place='foot'><p>
See pp. <ref target='page88'>88</ref>, <ref target='page109'>109</ref>, &amp;c. Lugh, of course, = Lux, Light. The
Celtic words <hi rend='italic'>Lamh</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>Llaw</hi> were used indifferently for hand or
arm.
</p></note> <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>Lugh Lamh Fada</foreign>. The misunderstood
name survived, and round the misunderstanding
legendary matter floating in the popular mind crystallised
itself in a new story.
</p>

<p>
These correspondences might be pursued in much
further detail. It is enough here to point to their existence
as evidence of the original community of Gaelic
and Cymric mythology.<note place='foot'><p>
Mr. Squire, in his <q>Mythology of the British Islands,</q> 1905,
has brought together in a clear and attractive form the most recent
results of studies on this subject.
</p></note> We are, in each literature,
in the same circle of mythological ideas. In Wales,
however, these ideas are harder to discern; the figures
and their relationships in the Welsh Olympus are less
accurately defined and more fluctuating. It would seem
as if a number of different tribes embodied what were
fundamentally the same conceptions under different
names and wove different legends about them. The
bardic literature, as we have it now, bears evidence sometimes
of the prominence of one of these tribal cults,
sometimes of another. To reduce these varying accounts
to unity is altogether impossible. Still, we can do something
to afford the reader a clue to the maze.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Houses of Dōn and of Llyr</hi>
</p>

<p>
Two great divine houses or families are discernible&mdash;that
of Dōn, a mother-goddess (representing the Gaelic
Dana), whose husband is Beli, the Irish Bilé, god of
Death, and whose descendants are the Children of Light;
and the House of Llyr, the Gaelic Lir, who here represents,
not a Danaan deity, but something more like the
Irish Fomorians. As in the case of the Irish myth, the
<pb n='349' id='page349'/>
two families are allied by intermarriage&mdash;Penardun,
a daughter of Dōn, is wedded to Llyr. Dōn herself
has a brother, Māth, whose name signifies wealth or
treasure (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Greek Pluton, <hi rend='italic'>ploutos</hi>), and they descend
from a figure indistinctly characterised, called Māthonwy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The House of Arthur</hi>
</p>

<p>
Into the pantheon of deities represented in the four
ancient Mabinogi there came, at a later time, from
some other tribal source, another group headed by
Arthur, the god Artaius. He takes the place of
Gwydion son of Dōn, and the other deities of his circle
fall more or less accurately into the places of others of
the earlier circle. The accompanying genealogical plans
are intended to help the reader to a general view of the
relationships and attributes of these personages. It
must be borne in mind, however, that these tabular
arrangements necessarily involve an appearance of precision
and consistency which is not reflected in the
fluctuating character of the actual myths taken as a
whole. Still, as a sketch-map of a very intricate and
obscure region, they may help the reader who enters it
for the first time to find his bearings in it, and that is
the only purpose they propose to serve.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Gwyn ap Nudd</hi>
</p>

<p>
The deity named Gwyn ap Nudd is said, like Finn
in Gaelic legend,<note place='foot'><p>
Finn and Gwyn are respectively the Gaelic and Cymric forms
of the same name, meaning fair or white.
</p></note> to have impressed himself more
deeply and lastingly on the Welsh popular imagination
than any of the other divinities. A mighty warrior
and huntsman, he glories in the crash of breaking
spears, and, like Odin, assembles the souls of dead
heroes in his shadowy kingdom, for although he belongs
<pb n='353' id='page353'/>
to the kindred of the Light-gods, Hades is his special
domain. The combat between him and Gwythur ap
Greidawl (Victor, son of Scorcher) for Creudylad,
daughter of Lludd, which is to be renewed every May-day
till time shall end, represents evidently the contest
between winter and summer for the flowery and fertile
earth. <q>Later,</q> writes Mr. Charles Squire, <q>he came
to be considered as King of the <hi rend='italic'>Tylwyth Teg</hi>, the Welsh
fairies, and his name as such has hardly yet died out of
his last haunt, the romantic vale of Neath.... He is
the Wild Huntsman of Wales and the West of England,
and it is his pack which is sometimes heard at chase in
waste places by night.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Mythology of the British Islands,</q> p. 225.
</p></note> He figures as a god of war
and death in a wonderful poem from the <q>Black Book
of Caermarthen,</q> where he is represented as discoursing
with a prince named Gwyddneu Garanhir, who had
come to ask his protection. I quote a few stanzas:
the poem will be found in full in Mr. Squire's excellent
volume:

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Myrddin, or Merlin</hi>
</p>

<p>
A deity named Myrddin holds in Arthur's mythological
cycle the place of the Sky- and Sun-god, Nudd.
One of the Welsh Triads tells us that Britain, before
it was inhabited, was called <foreign lang='cy' rend='italic'>Clas Myrddin</foreign>, Myrddin's
Enclosure. One is reminded of the Irish fashion of
calling any favoured spot a <q>cattle-fold of the sun</q>&mdash;the
name is applied by Deirdre to her beloved Scottish
home in Glen Etive. Professor Rhys suggests that
Myrddin was the deity specially worshipped at Stonehenge,
which, according to British tradition as reported
by Geoffrey of Monmouth, was erected by <q>Merlin,</q>
the enchanter who represents the form into which
Myrddin had dwindled under Christian influences.
We are told that the abode of Merlin was a house of
glass, or a bush of whitethorn laden with bloom, or a
sort of smoke or mist in the air, or <q>a close neither of
iron nor steel nor timber nor of stone, but of the air
<pb n='355' id='page355'/>
without any other thing, by enchantment so strong that
it may never be undone while the world endureth.</q><note place='foot'><p>
Rhys, <q>Hibbert Lectures,</q> quoting from the ancient saga of
Merlin published by the English Text Society, p. 693.
</p></note>
Finally he descended upon Bardsey Island, <q>off the
extreme westernmost point of Carnarvonshire ... into
it he went with nine attendant bards, taking with him
the 'Thirteen Treasures of Britain,' thenceforth lost to
men.</q> Professor Rhys points out that a Greek traveller
named Demetrius, who is described as having visited
Britain in the first century A.D., mentions an island in
the west where <q>Kronos</q> was supposed to be imprisoned
with his attendant deities, and Briareus keeping watch
over him as he slept, <q>for sleep was the bond forged
for him.</q> Doubtless we have here a version, Hellenised
as was the wont of classical writers on barbaric myths,
of a British story of the descent of the Sun-god into the
western sea, and his imprisonment there by the powers
of darkness, with the possessions and magical potencies
belonging to Light and Life.<note place='foot'><p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Nynniaw and Peibaw</hi>
</p>

<p>
The two personages called Nynniaw and Peibaw who
figure in the genealogical table play a very slight part in
Cymric mythology, but one story in which they appear
is interesting in itself and has an excellent moral. They
are represented<note place='foot'><p>
In the <q>Iolo MSS.,</q> collected by Edward Williams.
</p></note> as two brothers, Kings of Britain, who
were walking together one starlight night. <q>See what
a fine far-spreading field I have,</q> said Nynniaw. <q>Where
is it?</q> asked Peibaw. <q>There aloft and as far as you
can see,</q> said Nynniaw, pointing to the sky. <q>But
look at all my cattle grazing in your field,</q> said Peibaw.
<pb n='356' id='page356'/>
<q>Where are they?</q> said Nynniaw. <q>All the golden
stars,</q> said Peibaw, <q>with the moon for their shepherd.</q>
<q>They shall not graze on my field,</q> cried Nynniaw.
<q>I say they shall,</q> returned Peibaw. <q>They shall
not.</q> <q>They shall.</q> And so they went on: first they
quarrelled with each other, and then went to war, and
armies were destroyed and lands laid waste, till at last
the two brothers were turned into oxen as a punishment
for their stupidity and quarrelsomeness.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The <q>Mabinogion</q></hi>
</p>

<p>
We now come to the work in which the chief
treasures of Cymric myth and legend were collected by
Lady Charlotte Guest sixty years ago, and given to the
world in a translation which is one of the masterpieces
of English literature. The title of this work, the
<q>Mabinogion,</q> is the plural form of the word <foreign lang='cy' rend='italic'>Mabinogi</foreign>,
which means a story belonging to the equipment of an
apprentice-bard, such a story as every bard had necessarily
to learn as part of his training, whatever more he
might afterwards add to his <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>répertoire</foreign>. Strictly speaking,
the <foreign lang='cy' rend='italic'>Mabinogi</foreign> in the volume are only the four tales
given first in Mr. Alfred Nutt's edition, which were
entitled the <q>Four Branches of the Mabinogi,</q> and
which form a connected whole. They are among the
oldest relics of Welsh mythological saga.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Pwyll, Head of Hades</hi>
</p>

<p>
The first of them is the story of Pwyll, Prince of
Dyfed, and relates how that prince got his title of <hi rend='italic'>Pen
Annwn</hi>, or <q>Head of Hades</q>&mdash;Annwn being the term
under which we identify in Welsh literature the Celtic
Land of the Dead, or Fairyland. It is a story with a
mythological basis, but breathing the purest spirit of
chivalric honour and nobility.
</p>


<pb n='357' id='page357'/>

<p>
Pwyll, it is said, was hunting one day in the woods
of Glyn Cuch when he saw a pack of hounds, not his
own, running down a stag. These hounds were snow-white
in colour, with red ears. If Pwyll had had any
experience in these matters he would have known at
once what kind of hunt was up, for these are the
colours of Faëry&mdash;the red-haired man, the red-eared
hound are always associated with magic.<note place='foot'><p>
See, <hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>, pp. <ref target='page111'>111</ref>, <ref target='page272'>272</ref>.
</p></note> Pwyll, however,
drove off the strange hounds, and was setting his
own on the quarry when a horseman of noble appearance
came up and reproached him for his discourtesy.
Pwyll offered to make amends, and the story now
develops into the familiar theme of the Rescue of
Fairyland. The stranger's name is Arawn, a king in
Annwn. He is being harried and dispossessed by a
rival, Havgan, and he seeks the aid of Pwyll, whom he
begs to meet Havgan in single combat a year hence.
Meanwhile he will put his own shape on Pwyll, who is
to rule in his kingdom till the eventful day, while
Arawn will go in Pwyll's shape to govern Dyfed. He
instructs Pwyll how to deal with the foe. Havgan
must be laid low with a single stroke&mdash;if another is
given to him he immediately revives again as strong as
ever.
</p>

<p>
Pwyll agreed to follow up the adventure, and accordingly
went in Arawn's shape to the kingdom of Annwn.
Here he was placed in an unforeseen difficulty. The
beautiful wife of Arawn greeted him as her husband.
But when the time came for them to retire to rest he
set his face to the wall and said no word to her, nor
touched her at all until the morning broke. Then
they rose up, and Pwyll went to the hunt, and ruled his
kingdom, and did all things as if he were monarch of the
land. And whatever affection he showed to the queen
<pb n='358' id='page358'/>
in public during the day, he passed every night even as
this first.
</p>

<p>
At last the day of battle came, and, like the chieftains
in Gaelic story, Pwyll and Havgan met each other in
the midst of a river-ford. They fought, and at the
first clash Havgan was hurled a spear's length over the
crupper of his horse and fell mortally wounded.<note place='foot'><p>
We see here that we have got far from primitive Celtic legend.
The heroes fight like mediaeval knights on horseback, tilting at each
other with spears, not in chariots or on foot, and not with the
strange weapons which figure in Gaelic battle-tales.
</p></note> <q>For
the love of heaven,</q> said he, <q>slay me and complete
thy work.</q> <q>I may yet repent that,</q> said Pwyll.
<q>Slay thee who may, I will not.</q> Then Havgan knew
that his end was come, and bade his nobles bear him
off; and Pwyll with all his army overran the two
kingdoms of Annwn, and made himself master of all
the land, and took homage from its princes and lords.
</p>

<p>
Then he rode off alone to keep his tryst in Glyn
Cuch with Arawn as they had appointed. Arawn
thanked him for all he had done, and added: <q>When
thou comest thyself to thine own dominions thou wilt
see what I have done for thee.</q> They exchanged
shapes once more, and each rode in his own likeness to
take possession of his own land.
</p>

<p>
At the court of Annwn the day was spent in joy and
feasting, though none but Arawn himself knew that anything
unusual had taken place. When night came Arawn
kissed and caressed his wife as of old, and she pondered
much as to what might be the cause of his change towards
her, and of his previous change a year and a day before.
And as she was thinking over these things Arawn spoke
to her twice or thrice, but got no answer. He then
asked her why she was silent. <q>I tell thee,</q> she said,
<q>that for a year I have not spoken so much in this
<pb n='359' id='page359'/>
place.</q> <q>Did not we speak continually?</q> he said.
<q>Nay,</q> said she, <q>but for a year back there has been
neither converse nor tenderness between us.</q> <q>Good
heaven!</q> thought Arawn, <q>a man as faithful and firm
in his friendship as any have I found for a friend.</q>
Then he told his queen what had passed. <q>Thou hast
indeed laid hold of a faithful friend,</q> she said.
</p>

<p>
And Pwyll when he came back to his own land
called his lords together and asked them how they
thought he had sped in his kingship during the past
year. <q>Lord,</q> said they, <q>thy wisdom was never so
great, and thou wast never so kind and free in bestowing
thy gifts, and thy justice was never more worthily
seen than in this year.</q> Pwyll then told them the
story of his adventure. <q>Verily, lord,</q> said they,
<q>render thanks unto heaven that thou hast such a
fellowship, and withhold not from us the rule which we
have enjoyed for this year past.</q> <q>I take heaven to
witness that I will not withhold it,</q> said Pwyll.
</p>

<p>
So the two kings made strong the friendship that was
between them, and sent each other rich gifts of horses
and hounds and jewels; and in memory of the adventure
Pwyll bore thenceforward the title of <q>Lord of
Annwn.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Wedding of Pwyll and Rhiannon</hi>
</p>

<p>
Near to the castle of Narberth, where Pwyll had his
court, there was a mound called the Mound of Arberth,
of which it was believed that whoever sat upon it would
have a strange adventure: either he would receive
blows and wounds or he would see a wonder. One
day when all his lords were assembled at Narberth for
a feast Pwyll declared that he would sit on the mound
and see what would befall.
</p>

<p>
He did so, and after a little while saw approaching
<pb n='360' id='page360'/>
him along the road that led to the mound a lady clad
in garments that shone like gold, and sitting on a
pure white horse. <q>Is there any among you,</q> said
Pwyll to his men, <q>who knows that lady?</q> <q>There
is not,</q> said they. <q>Then go to meet her and learn
who she is.</q> But as they rode towards the lady she
moved away from them, and however fast they rode
she still kept an even distance between her and them,
yet never seemed to exceed the quiet pace with which
she had first approached.
</p>

<p>
Several times did Pwyll seek to have the lady
overtaken and questioned, but all was in vain&mdash;none
could draw near to her.
</p>

<p>
Next day Pwyll ascended the mound again, and once
more the fair lady on her white steed drew near. This
time Pwyll himself pursued her, but she flitted away
before him as she had done before his servants, till at
last he cried : <q>O maiden, for the sake of him thou
best lovest, stay for me.</q> <q>I will stay gladly,</q> said
she, <q>and it were better for thy horse had thou asked
it long since.</q>
</p>

<p>
Pwyll then questioned her as to the cause of her
coming, and she said: <q>I am Rhiannon, the daughter
of Hevydd Hēn,<note place='foot'><p>
Hēn, <q>the Ancient</q>; an epithet generally implying a hoary
antiquity associated with mythological tradition.
</p></note> and they sought to give me to a
husband against my will. But no husband would I
have, and that because of my love for thee; neither will
I yet have one if thou reject me.</q> <q>By heaven!</q>
said Pwyll, <q>if I might choose among all the ladies
and damsels of the world, thee would I choose.</q>
</p>

<p>
They then agree that in a twelvemonth from that
day Pwyll is to come and claim her at the palace of
Hevydd Hēn.
</p>

<p>
Pwyll kept his tryst, with a following of a hundred
<pb n='361' id='page361'/>
knights, and found a splendid feast prepared for him,
and he sat by his lady, with her father on the other
side. As they feasted and talked there entered a tall,
auburn-haired youth of royal bearing, clad in satin,
who saluted Pwyll and his knights. Pwyll invited
him to sit down. <q>Nay, I am a suitor to thee,</q> said
the youth; <q>to crave a boon am I come.</q> <q>Whatever
thou wilt thou shalt have,</q> said Pwyll unsuspiciously,
<q>if it be in my power.</q> <q>Ah,</q> cried Rhiannon,
<q>wherefore didst thou give that answer?</q> <q>Hath
he not given it before all these nobles?</q> said the
youth; <q>and now the boon I crave is to have thy
bride Rhiannon, and the feast and the banquet that are
in this place.</q> Pwyll was silent. <q>Be silent as long
as thou wilt,</q> said Rhiannon. <q>Never did man make
worse use of his wits than thou hast done.</q> She tells
him that the auburn-haired young man is Gwawl, son
of Clud, and is the suitor to escape from whom she
had fled to Pwyll.
</p>


<p>
Pwyll is bound in honour by his word, and Rhiannon
explains that the banquet cannot be given to Gwawl,
for it is not in Pwyll's power, but that she herself will
be his bride in a twelvemonth; Gwawl is to come and
claim her then, and a new bridal feast will be prepared
for him. Meantime she concerts a plan with Pwyll,
and gives him a certain magical bag, which he is to
make use of when the time shall come.
</p>

<p>
A year passed away, Gwawl appeared according to
the compact, and a great feast was again set forth, in
which he, and not Pwyll, had the place of honour. As
the company were making merry, however, a beggar
clad in rags and shod with clumsy old shoes came into
the hall, carrying a bag, as beggars are wont to do. He
humbly craved a boon of Gwawl. It was merely that
the full of his bag of food might be given him from
<pb n='362' id='page362'/>
the banquet. Gwawl cheerfully consented, and an
attendant went to fill the bag. But however much
they put into it it never got fuller&mdash;by degrees all
the good things on the tables had gone in; and at last
Gwawl cried: <q>My soul, will thy bag never be full?</q>
<q>It will not, I declare to heaven,</q> answered Pwyll&mdash;for
he, of course, was the disguised beggar man&mdash;<q>unless
some man wealthy in lands and treasure shall
get into the bag and stamp it down with his feet, and
declare, <q>Enough has been put herein.</q></q> Rhiannon
urged Gwawl to check the voracity of the bag. He put
his two feet into it; Pwyll immediately drew up the
sides of the bag over Gwawl's head and tied it up.
Then he blew his horn, and the knights he had with
him, who were concealed outside, rushed in, and
captured and bound the followers of Gwawl. <q>What
is in the bag?</q> they cried, and others answered, <q>A
badger,</q> and so they played the game of <q>Badger in
the Bag,</q> striking it and kicking it about the hall.
</p>

<p>
At last a voice was heard from it. <q>Lord,</q> cried
Gwawl, <q>if thou wouldst but hear me, I merit not to
be slain in a bag.</q> <q>He speaks truth,</q> said Hevydd
Hēn.
</p>

<p>
So an agreement was come to that Gwawl should
provide means for Pwyll to satisfy all the suitors and
minstrels who should come to the wedding, and
abandon Rhiannon, and never seek to have revenge
for what had been done to him. This was confirmed
by sureties, and Gwawl and his men were released and
went to their own territory. And Pwyll wedded
Rhiannon, and dispensed gifts royally to all and
sundry; and at last the pair, when the feasting was
done, journeyed down to the palace of Narberth in
Dyfed, where Rhiannon gave rich gifts, a bracelet and
a ring or a precious stone to all the lords and ladies of
<pb n='363' id='page363'/>
her new country, and they ruled the land in peace
both that year and the next. But the reader will find
that we have not yet done with Gwawl.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Penance of Rhiannon</hi>
</p>

<p>
Now Pwyll was still without an heir to the throne,
and his nobles urged him to take another wife. <q>Grant
us a year longer,</q> said he, <q>and if there be no heir
after that it shall be as you wish.</q> Before the year's
end a son was born to them in Narberth. But although
six women sat up to watch the mother and the infant,
it happened towards the morning that they all fell
asleep, and Rhiannon also slept, and when the women
awoke, behold, the boy was gone! <q>We shall be
burnt for this,</q> said the women, and in their terror
they concocted a horrible plot: they killed a cub of
a staghound that had just been littered, and laid the
bones by Rhiannon, and smeared her face and hands
with blood as she slept, and when she woke and asked
for her child they said she had devoured it in the night,
and had overcome them with furious strength when
they would have prevented her&mdash;and for all she could
say or do the six women persisted in this story.
</p>

<p>
When the story was told to Pwyll he would not put
away Rhiannon, as his nobles now again begged him to
do, but a penance was imposed on her&mdash;namely, that
she was to sit every day by the horse-block at the gate
of the castle and tell the tale to every stranger who
came, and offer to carry them on her back into the castle.
And this she did for part of a year.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Finding of Pryderi</hi><note place='foot'><p>
Pronounced <q>Pry-dair´y.</q>
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Now at this time there lived a man named Teirnyon
of Gwent Is Coed, who had the most beautiful mare in
<pb n='364' id='page364'/>
the world, but there was this misfortune attending her,
that although she foaled on the night of every first of
May, none ever knew what became of the colts. At
last Teirnyon resolved to get at the truth of the matter,
and the next night on which the mare should foal he
armed himself and watched in the stable. So the mare
foaled, and the colt stood up, and Teirnyon was admiring
its size and beauty when a great noise was heard outside,
and a long, clawed arm came through the window
of the stable and laid hold of the colt. Teirnyon immediately
smote at the arm with his sword, and severed it
at the elbow, so that it fell inside with the colt, and a
great wailing and tumult was heard outside. He rushed
out, leaving the door open behind him, but could see
nothing because of the darkness of the night, and he
followed the noise a little way. Then he came back,
and behold, at the door he found an infant in swaddling-clothes
and wrapped in a mantle of satin. He took up
the child and brought it to where his wife lay sleeping.
She had no children, and she loved the child when she
saw it, and next day pretended to her women that she
had borne it as her own. And they called its name
Gwri of the Golden Hair, for its hair was yellow as gold;
and it grew so mightily that in two years it was as big
and strong as a child of six; and ere long the colt that
had been foaled on the same night was broken in and
given him to ride.
</p>

<p>
While these things were going on Teirnyon heard the
tale of Rhiannon and her punishment. And as the lad
grew up he scanned his face closely and saw that he had
the features of Pwyll Prince of Dyfed. This he told to
his wife, and they agreed that the child should be taken
to Narberth, and Rhiannon released from her penance.
</p>

<p>
As they drew near to the castle, Teirnyon and two
knights and the child riding on his colt, there was
<pb n='365' id='page365'/>
Rhiannon sitting by the horse-block. <q>Chieftains,</q>
said she, <q>go not further thus; I will bear every one of
you into the palace, and this is my penance for slaying
my own son and devouring him.</q> But they would not
be carried, and went in. Pwyll rejoiced to see Teirnyon,
and made a feast for him. Afterwards Teirnyon declared
to Pwyll and Rhiannon the adventure of the man and
the colt, and how they had found the boy. <q>And
behold, here is thy son, lady,</q> said Teirnyon, <q>and
whoever told that lie concerning thee has done wrong.</q>
All who sat at table recognised the lad at once as the
child of Pwyll, and Rhiannon cried: <q>I declare to heaven
that if this be true there is an end to my trouble.</q> And
a chief named Pendaran said: <q>Well hast thou named
thy son Pryderi [trouble], and well becomes him the
name of Pryderi son of Pwyll, Lord of Annwn.</q> It
was agreed that his name should be Pryderi, and so
he was called thenceforth.
</p>

<p>
Teirnyon rode home, overwhelmed with thanks and
love and gladness; and Pwyll offered him rich gifts of
horses and jewels and dogs, but he would take none of
them. And Pryderi was trained up, as befitted a king's
son, in all noble ways and accomplishments, and when
his father Pwyll died he reigned in his stead over the
Seven Cantrevs of Dyfed. And he added to them many
other fair dominions, and at last he took to wife Kicva,
daughter of Gwynn Gohoyw, who came of the lineage
of Prince Casnar of Britain.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tale of Bran and Branwen</hi>
</p>

<p>
Bendigeid Vran, or <q>Bran the Blessed,</q> by which
latter name we shall designate him here, when he had
been made King of the Isle of the Mighty (Britain),
was one time in his court at Harlech. And he had
with him his brother Manawyddan son of Llyr, and his
<pb n='366' id='page366'/>
sister Branwen, and the two sons, Nissyen and Evnissyen,
that Penardun his mother bore to Eurosswyd. Now
Nissyen was a youth of gentle nature, and would make
peace among his kindred and cause them to be friends
when their wrath was at its highest; but Evnissyen
loved nothing so much as to turn peace into contention
and strife.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, as Bran son of Llyr sat on the rock
of Harlech looking out to sea, he beheld thirteen ships
coming rapidly from Ireland before a fair wind. They
were gaily furnished, bright flags flying from the masts,
and on the foremost ship, when they came near, a man
could be seen holding up a shield with the point
upwards in sign of peace.<note place='foot'><p>
Evidently this was the triangular Norman shield, not the round
or oval Celtic one. It has already been noticed that in these Welsh
tales the knights when they fight tilt at each other with spears.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
When the strangers landed they saluted Bran and
explained their business. Matholwch,<note place='foot'><p>
The reader may pronounce this <q>Matholaw.</q>
</p></note> King of Ireland,
was with them; his were the ships, and he had come to
ask for the hand in marriage of Bran's sister, Branwen,
so that Ireland and Britain might be leagued together
and both become more powerful. <q>Now Branwen was
one of the three chief ladies of the island, and she was
the fairest damsel in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Irish were hospitably entertained, and after
taking counsel with his lords Bran agreed to give
his sister to Matholwch. The place of the wedding
was fixed at Aberffraw, and the company assembled for
the feast in tents because no house could hold the giant
form of Bran. They caroused and made merry in peace
and amity, and Branwen became the bride or the Irish
king.
</p>

<p>
Next day Evnissyen came by chance to where the
<pb n='367' id='page367'/>
horses of Matholwch were ranged, and he asked whose
they were. <q>They are the horses of Matholwch, who
is married to thy sister.</q> <q>And is it thus,</q> said he,
<q>they have done with a maiden such as she, and, moreover,
my sister, bestowing her without my consent?
They could offer me no greater insult.</q> Thereupon
he rushed among the horses and cut off their lips at the
teeth, and their ears to their heads, and their tails close
to the body, and where he could seize the eyelids he cut
them off to the bone.
</p>

<p>
When Matholwch heard what had been done he was
both angered and bewildered, and bade his people put to
sea. Bran sent messengers to learn what had happened,
and when he had been informed he sent Manawyddan
and two others to make atonement. Matholwch should
have sound horses for every one that was injured, and
in addition a staff of silver as large and as tall as himself,
and a plate of gold the size of his face. <q>And let him
come and meet me,</q> he added, <q>and we will make peace
in any way he may desire.</q> But as for Evnissyen, he
was the son of Bran's mother, and therefore Bran could
not put him to death as he deserved.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Magic Cauldron</hi>
</p>

<p>
Matholwch accepted these terms, but not very cheerfully,
and Bran now offered another treasure, namely, a
magic cauldron which had the property that if a slain
man were cast into it he would come forth well and
sound, only he would not be able to speak. Matholwch
and Bran then talked about the cauldron, which originally,
it seems, came from Ireland. There was a lake in that
country near to a mound (doubtless a fairy mound)
which was called the Lake of the Cauldron. Here
Matholwch had once met a tall and ill-looking fellow
with a wife bigger than himself, and the cauldron
<pb n='368' id='page368'/>
strapped on his back. They took service with
Matholwch. At the end of a period of six weeks
the wife gave birth to a son, who was a warrior fully
armed. We are apparently to understand that this
happened every six weeks, for by the end of the year
the strange pair, who seem to be a war-god and goddess,
had several children, whose continual bickering and the
outrages they committed throughout the land made
them hated. At last, to get rid of them, Matholwch
had a house of iron made, and enticed them into it.
He then barred the door and heaped coals about the
chamber, and blew them into a white heat, hoping to
roast the whole family to death. As soon, however, as
the iron walls had grown white-hot and soft the man
and his wife burst through them and got away, but the
children remained behind and were destroyed. Bran
then took up the story. The man, who was called
Llassar Llaesgyvnewid, and his wife Kymideu Kymeinvoll,
come across to Britain, where Bran took them
in, and in return for his kindness they gave him the
cauldron. And since then they had filled the land
with their descendants, who prospered everywhere and
dwelt in strong fortified burgs and had the best weapons
that ever were seen.
</p>

<p>
So Matholwch received the cauldron along with his
bride, and sailed back to Ireland, where Branwen entertained
the lords and ladies of the land, and gave to each,
as he or she took leave, <q>either a clasp or a ring or a
royal jewel to keep, such as it was honourable to be seen
departing with.</q> And when the year was out Branwen
bore a son to Matholwch, whose name was called Gwern.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Punishment of Branwen</hi>
</p>

<p>
There occurs now an unintelligible place in the
story. In the second year, it appears, and not till then,
<pb n='369' id='page369'/>
the men of Ireland grew indignant over the insult to
their king committed by Evnissyen, and took revenge
for it by having Branwen degraded to the position of a
cook, and they caused the butcher every day to give her
a blow on the ears. They also forbade all ships and
ferry-boats to cross to Cambria, and any who came
thence into Ireland were imprisoned so that news of
Branwen's ill-treatment might not come to the ears of
Bran. But Branwen reared up a young starling in a
corner of her kneading-trough, and one day she tied a
letter under its wing and taught it what to do. It flew
away towards Britain, and finding Bran at Caer Seiont
in Arvon, it lit on his shoulder, ruffling its feathers, and
the letter was found and read. Bran immediately prepared
a great hosting for Ireland, and sailed thither
with a fleet of ships, leaving his land of Britain under
his son Caradawc and six other chiefs.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Invasion of Bran</hi>
</p>

<p>
Soon there came messengers to Matholwch telling him
of a wondrous sight they had seen; a wood was growing
on the sea, and beside the wood a mountain with a high
ridge in the middle of it, and two lakes, one at each
side. And wood and mountain moved towards the
shore of Ireland. Branwen is called up to explain, if
she could, what this meant. She tells them the wood
is the masts and yards of the fleet of Britain, and the
mountain is Bran, her brother, coming into shoal water,
<q>for no ship can contain him</q>; the ridge is his nose,
the lakes his two eyes.<note place='foot'><p>
Compare the description of Mac Cecht in the tale of the Hostel
of De Derga, p. 173.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
The King of Ireland and his lords at once took
counsel together how they might meet this danger;
and the plan they agreed upon was as follows: A huge
<pb n='370' id='page370'/>
hall should be built, big enough to hold Bran&mdash;this, it
was hoped, would placate him&mdash;there should be a great
feast made there for himself and his men, and Matholwch
should give over the kingdom of Ireland to him and
do homage. All this was done by Branwen's advice.
But the Irish added a crafty device of their own. From
two brackets on each of the hundred pillars in the hall
should be hung two leather bags, with an armed warrior
in each of them ready to fall upon the guests when the
moment should arrive.
</p>


<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Meal-bags</hi>
</p>

<p>
Evnissyen, however, wandered into the hall before
the rest of the host, and scanning the arrangements
<q>with fierce and savage looks,</q> he saw the bags which
hung from the pillars. <q>What is in this bag?</q> said
he to one of the Irish. <q>Meal, good soul,</q> said the
Irishman. Evnissyen laid his hand on the bag, and
felt about with his fingers till he came to the head of
the man within it. Then <q>he squeezed the head till
he felt his fingers meet together in the brain through
the bone.</q> He went to the next bag, and asked the
same question. <q>Meal,</q> said the Irish attendant, but
Evnissyen crushed this warrior's head also, and thus
he did with all the two hundred bags, even in the
case of one warrior whose head was covered with an
iron helm.
</p>

<p>
Then the feasting began, and peace and concord
reigned, and Matholwch laid down the sovranty of
Ireland, which was conferred on the boy Gwern. And
they all fondled and caressed the fair child till he
came to Evnissyen, who suddenly seized him and flung
him into the blazing fire on the hearth. Branwen
would have leaped after him, but Bran held her back.
Then there was arming apace, and tumult and shouting,
<pb n='371' id='page371'/>
and the Irish and British hosts closed in battle and
fought until the fall of night.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Death of Evnissyen</hi>
</p>

<p>
But at night the Irish heated the magic cauldron and
threw into it the bodies of their dead, who came out
next day as good as ever, but dumb. When Evnissyen
saw this he was smitten with remorse for having brought
the men of Britain into such a strait: <q>Evil betide me
if I find not a deliverance therefrom.</q> So he hid himself
among the Irish dead, and was flung into the
cauldron with the rest at the end of the second day,
when he stretched himself out so that he rent the
cauldron into four pieces, and his own heart burst with
the effort, and he died.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Wonderful Head</hi>
</p>

<p>
In the end, all the Irishmen were slain, and all but
seven of the British besides Bran, who was wounded in
the foot with a poisoned arrow. Among the seven
were Pryderi and Manawyddan. Bran then commanded
them to cut off his head. <q>And take it with you,</q>
he said, <q>to London, and there bury it in the White
Mount<note place='foot'><p>
Where the Tower of London now stands.
</p></note> looking towards France, and no foreigner shall
invade the land while it is there. On the way the
Head will talk to you, and be as pleasant company as
ever in life. In Harlech ye will be feasting seven years
and the birds of Rhiannon will sing to you. And at
Gwales in Penvro ye will be feasting fourscore years, and
the Head will talk to you and be uncorrupted till ye
open the door looking towards Cornwall. After that
ye may no longer tarry, but set forth to London and
bury the Head.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then the seven cut off the head of Bran and went
<pb n='372' id='page372'/>
forth, and Branwen with them, to do his bidding. But
when Branwen came to land at Aber Alaw she cried,
<q>Woe is me that I was ever born; two islands have
been destroyed because of me.</q> And she uttered a
loud groan, and her heart broke. They made her a
four-sided grave on the banks of the Alaw, and the place
was called <hi rend='italic'>Ynys Branwen</hi> to this day.<note place='foot'><p>
These stories, in Ireland and in Wales, always attach themselves
to actual burial-places. In 1813 a funeral urn containing ashes and
half-burnt bones was found in the spot traditionally supposed to be
Branwen's sepulchre.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
The seven found that in the absence of Bran, Caswallan
son of Beli had conquered Britain and slain the
six captains of Caradawc. By magic art he had thrown
on Caradawc the Veil of Illusion, and Caradawc saw
only the sword which slew and slew, but not him who
wielded it, and his heart broke for grief at the sight.
</p>

<p>
They then went to Harlech and remained there seven
years listening to the singing of the birds of Rhiannon&mdash;<q>all
the songs they had ever heard were unpleasant
compared thereto.</q> Then they went to Gwales in
Penvro and found a fair and spacious hall overlooking
the ocean. When they entered it they forgot all the
sorrow of the past and all that had befallen them, and
remained there fourscore years in joy and mirth, the
wondrous Head talking to them as if it were alive. And
bards call this <q>the Entertaining of the Noble Head.</q>
Three doors were in the hall, and one of them which
looked to Cornwall and to Aber Henvelyn was closed,
but the other two were open. At the end of the time,
Heilyn son of Gwyn said, <q>Evil betide me if I do not
open the door to see if what was said is true.</q> And
he opened it, and at once remembrance and sorrow fell
upon them, and they set forth at once for London and
buried the Head in the White Mount, where it remained
<pb n='373' id='page373'/>
until Arthur dug it up, for he would not have the land
defended but by the strong arm. And this was <q>the
Third Fatal Disclosure</q> in Britain.
</p>

<p>
So ends this wild tale, which is evidently full of mythological
elements, the key to which has long been lost.
The touches of Northern ferocity which occur in it
have made some critics suspect the influence of Norse
or Icelandic literature in giving it its present form.
The character of Evnissyen would certainly lend countenance
to this conjecture. The typical mischief-maker
of course occurs in purely Celtic sagas, but not commonly
in combination with the heroic strain shown in
Evnissyen's end, nor does the Irish <q>poison-tongue</q>
ascend to anything like the same height of daimonic
malignity.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tale of Pryderi and Manawyddan</hi>
</p>

<p>
After the events of the previous tales Pryderi and
Manawyddan retired to the dominions of the former,
and Manawyddan took to wife Rhiannon, the mother
of his friend. There they lived happily and prosperously
till one day, while they were at the Gorsedd,
or Mound, near Narberth, a peal of thunder was heard
and a thick mist fell so that nothing could be seen all
round. When the mist cleared away, behold, the land
was bare before them&mdash;neither houses nor people nor
cattle nor crops were to be seen, but all was desert and
uninhabited. The palace of Narberth was still standing,
but it was empty and desolate&mdash;none remained except
Pryderi and Manawyddan and their wives, Kicva and
Rhiannon.
</p>

<p>
Two years they lived on the provisions they had, and
on the prey they killed, and on wild honey; and then
they began to be weary. <q>Let us go into Lloegyr,</q><note place='foot'><p>
Saxon Britain.
</p></note>
<pb n='374' id='page374'/>
then said Manawyddan, <q>and seek out some craft to
support ourselves.</q> So they went to Hereford and
settled there, and Manawyddan and Pryderi began to
make saddles and housings, and Manawyddan decorated
them with blue enamel as he had learned from a great
craftsman, Llasar Llaesgywydd. After a time, however,
the other saddlers of Hereford, finding that no man
would purchase any but the work of Manawyddan, conspired
to kill them. And Pryderi would have fought
with them, but Manawyddan held it better to withdraw
elsewhere, and so they did.
</p>

<p>
They settled then in another city, where they made
shields such as never were seen, and here, too, in the
end, the rival craftsmen drove them out. And this
happened also in another town where they made shoes;
and at last they resolved to go back to Dyfed. Then
they gathered their dogs about them and lived by hunting
as before.
</p>

<p>
One day they started a wild white boar, and chased
him in vain until he led them up to a vast and lofty
castle, all newly built in a place where they had never
seen a building before. The boar ran into the castle,
the dogs followed him, and Pryderi, against the counsel
of Manawyddan, who knew there was magic afoot, went
in to seek for the dogs.
</p>

<p>
He found in the centre of the court a marble fountain
beside which stood a golden bowl on a marble slab, and
being struck by the rich workmanship of the bowl, he
laid hold of it to examine it, when he could neither
withdraw his hand nor utter a single sound, but he
remained there, transfixed and dumb, beside the
fountain.
</p>

<p>
Manawyddan went back to Narberth and told the
story to Rhiannon. <q>An evil companion hast thou
been,</q> said she, <q>and a good companion hast thou lost.</q>
</p>


<pb n='375' id='page375'/>

<p>
Next day she went herself to explore the castle. She
found Pryderi still clinging to the bowl and unable to
speak. She also, then, laid hold of the bowl, when the
same fate befell her, and immediately afterwards came
a peal of thunder, and a heavy mist fell, and when it
cleared off the castle had vanished with all that it contained,
including the two spell-bound wanderers.
</p>

<p>
Manawyddan then went back to Narberth, where only
Kicva, Pryderi's wife, now remained. And when she saw
none but herself and Manawyddan in the place, <q>she
sorrowed so that she cared not whether she lived or died.</q>
When Manawyddan saw this he said to her, <q>Thou art in
the wrong if through fear of me thou grievest thus. I
declare to thee were I in the dawn of youth I would
keep my faith unto Pryderi, and unto thee also will I
keep it.</q> <q>Heaven reward thee,</q> she said, <q>and that
is what I deemed of thee.</q> And thereupon she took
courage and was glad.
</p>

<p>
Kicva and Manawyddan then again tried to support
themselves by shoemaking in Lloegyr, but the same
hostility drove them back to Dyfed. This time, however,
Manawyddan took back with him a load of wheat,
and he sowed it, and he prepared three crofts for a
wheat crop. Thus the time passed till the fields were
ripe. And he looked at one of the crofts and said, <q>I
will reap this to-morrow.</q> But on the morrow when
he went out in the grey dawn he found nothing there
but bare straw&mdash;every ear had been cut off from the
stalk and carried away.
</p>

<p>
Next day it was the same with the second croft. But
on the following night he armed himself and sat up to
watch the third croft to see who was plundering him.
At midnight, as he watched, he heard a loud noise, and
behold, a mighty host of mice came pouring into the
croft, and they climbed up each on a stalk and nibbled
<pb n='376' id='page376'/>
off the ears and made away with them. He chased them
in anger, but they fled far faster than he could run, all
save one which was slower in its movements, and this
he barely managed to overtake, and he bound it into
his glove and took it home to Narberth, and told Kicva
what had happened. <q>To-morrow,</q> he said, <q>I will
hang the robber I have caught,</q> but Kicva thought it
beneath his dignity to take vengeance on a mouse.
</p>

<p>
Next day he went up to the Mound of Narberth and
set up two forks for a gallows on the highest part of
the hill. As he was doing this a poor scholar came
towards him, and he was the first person Manawyddan
had seen in Dyfed, except his own companions, since
the enchantment began.
</p>

<p>
The scholar asked him what he was about and begged
him to let go the mouse&mdash;<q>Ill doth it become a man
of thy rank to touch such a reptile as this.</q> <q>I will
not let it go, by Heaven,</q> said Manawyddan, and by
that he abode, although the scholar offered him a pound
of money to let it go free. <q>I care not,</q> said the
scholar, <q>except that I would not see a man of rank
touching such a reptile,</q> and with that he went his way.
</p>

<p>
As Manawyddan was placing the cross-beam on the
two forks of his gallows, a priest came towards him
riding on a horse with trappings, and the same conversation
ensued. The priest offered three pounds for the
mouse's life, but Manawyddan refused to take any price
for it. <q>Willingly, lord, do thy good pleasure,</q> said
the priest, and he, too, went his way.
</p>

<p>
Then Manawyddan put a noose about the mouse's
neck and was about to draw it up when he saw coming
towards him a bishop with a great retinue of sumpter-horses
and attendants. And he stayed his work and
asked the bishop's blessing. <q>Heaven's blessing be
unto thee,</q> said the bishop; <q>what work art thou
<pb n='377' id='page377'/>
upon?</q> <q>Hanging a thief,</q> replied Manawyddan. The
bishop offered seven pounds <q>rather than see a man of
thy rank destroying so vile a reptile.</q> Manawyddan
refused. Four-and-twenty pounds was then offered,
and then as much again, then all the bishop's horses and
baggage&mdash;all in vain. <q>Since for this thou wilt not,</q>
said the bishop, <q>do it at whatever price thou wilt.</q>
<q>I will do so,</q> said Manawyddan; <q>I will that Rhiannon
and Pryderi be free.</q> <q>That thou shalt have,</q> said
the (pretended) bishop. Then Manawyddan demands
that the enchantment and illusion be taken off for ever
from the seven Cantrevs of Dyfed, and finally insists
that the bishop shall tell him who the mouse is and why
the enchantment was laid on the country. <q>I am Llwyd
son of Kilcoed,</q> replies the enchanter, <q>and the mouse
is my wife; but that she is pregnant thou hadst never
overtaken her.</q> He goes on with an explanation which
takes us back to the first <hi rend='italic'>Mabinogi</hi> of the Wedding of
Rhiannon. The charm was cast on the land to avenge
the ill that was done Llwyd's friend, Gwawl son of
Clud, with whom Pryderi's father and his knights had
played <q>Badger in the Bag</q> at the court of Hevydd
Hēn. The mice were the lords and ladies of Llwyd's
court.
</p>

<p>
The enchanter is then made to promise that no
further vengeance shall be taken on Pryderi, Rhiannon,
or Manawyddan, and the two spell-bound captives
having been restored, the mouse is released. <q>Then
Llwyd struck her with a magic wand, and she was
changed into a young woman, the fairest ever seen.</q>
And on looking round Manawyddan saw all the land
tilled and peopled as in its best state, and full of herds
and dwellings. <q>What bondage,</q> he asks, <q>has there
been upon Pryderi and Rhiannon?</q> <q>Pryderi has had
the knockers of the gate of my palace about his neck,
<pb n='378' id='page378'/>
and Rhiannon has had the collars of the asses after they
have been carrying hay about her neck.</q> And such
had been their bondage.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tale of Māth Son of Māthonwy</hi>
</p>

<p>
The previous tale was one of magic and illusion in
which the mythological element is but faint. In that
which we have now to consider we are, however, in a
distinctly mythological region. The central motive of
the tale shows us the Powers of Light contending with
those of the Under-world for the prized possessions of
the latter, in this case a herd of magic swine. We are
introduced in the beginning of the story to the deity,
Māth, of whom the bard tells us that he was unable to
exist unless his feet lay in the lap of a maiden, except
when the land was disturbed by war.<note place='foot'><p>
This is a distorted reminiscence of the practice which seems to
have obtained in the courts of Welsh princes, that a high officer
should hold the king's feet in his lap while he sat at meat.
</p></note> Māth is represented
as lord of Gwynedd, while Pryderi rules over
the one-and-twenty cantrevs of the south. With Māth
were his nephews Gwydion and Gilvaethwy sons of
Dōn, who went the circuit of the land in his stead,
while Māth lay with his feet in the lap of the fairest
maiden of the land and time, Goewin daughter of Pebin
of Dōl Pebin in Arvon.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Gwydion and the Swine of Pryderi</hi>
</p>

<p>
Gilvaethwy fell sick of love for Goewin, and confided
the secret to his brother Gwydion, who undertook to
help him to his desire. So he went to Māth one day,
and asked his leave to go to Pryderi and beg from him
the gift, for Māth, of a herd of swine which had been
bestowed on him by Arawn King of Annwn. <q>They
are beasts,</q> he said, <q>such as never were known in
<pb n='379' id='page379'/>
this island before ... their flesh is better than the
flesh of oxen.</q> Māth bade him go, and he and
Gilvaethwy started with ten companions for Dyfed.
They came to Pryderi's palace in the guise of bards,
and Gwydion, after being entertained at a feast, was
asked to tell a tale to the court. After delighting
every one with his discourse he begged for a gift of the
swine. But Pryderi was under a compact with his
people neither to sell nor give them until they had
produced double their number in the land. <q>Thou
mayest exchange them, though,</q> said Gwydion, and
thereupon he made by magic arts an illusion of twelve
horses magnificently caparisoned, and twelve hounds,
and gave them to Pryderi and made off with the swine
as fast as possible, <q>for,</q> said he to his companions,
<q>the illusion will not last but from one hour to the
same to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
The intended result came to pass&mdash;Pryderi invaded
the land to recover his swine, Māth went to meet him
in arms, and Gilvaethwy seized his opportunity and
made Goewin his wife, although she was unwilling.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Death of Pryderi</hi>
</p>

<p>
The war was decided by a single combat between
Gwydion and Pryderi. <q>And by force of strength
and fierceness, and by the magic and charms of
Gwydion, Pryderi was slain. And at Maen Tyriawc,
above Melenryd, was he buried, and there is his
grave.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Penance of Gwydion and Gilvaethwy</hi>
</p>

<p>
When Māth came back he found what Gilvaethwy
had done, and he took Goewin to be his queen, but
Gwydion and Gilvaethwy went into outlawry, and
dwelt on the borders of the land. At last they came
<pb n='380' id='page380'/>
and submitted themselves for punishment to Māth.
<q>Ye cannot compensate me my shame, setting aside
the death of Pryderi,</q> he said, <q>but since ye come
hither to be at my will, I shall begin your punishment
forthwith.</q> So he turned them both into deer, and
bade them come hither again in a twelvemonth.
</p>

<p>
They came at the appointed time, bringing with them
a young fawn. And the fawn was brought into human
shape and baptized, and Gwydion and Gilvaethwy were
changed into two wild swine. At the next year's end
they came back with a young one who was treated as
the fawn before him, and the brothers were made into
wolves. Another year passed; they came back again
with a young wolf as before, and this time their penance
was deemed complete, and their human nature was
restored to them, and Māth gave orders to have them
washed and anointed, and nobly clad as was befitting.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Children of Arianrod: Dylan</hi>
</p>

<p>
The question then arose of appointing another
virgin foot-holder, and Gwydion suggests his sister,
Arianrod. She attends for the purpose, and Māth
asks her if she is a virgin. <q>I know not, lord, other
than that I am,</q> she says. But she failed in a magical
test imposed by Māth, and gave birth to two sons.
One of these was named Dylan, <q>Son of the Wave,</q>
evidently a Cymric sea-deity. So soon as he was
baptized <q>he plunged into the sea and swam as well
as the best fish that was therein.... Beneath him
no wave ever broke.</q> A wild sea-poetry hangs about
his name in Welsh legend. On his death, which took
place, it is said, at the hand of his uncle Govannon, all
the waves of Britain and Ireland wept for him. The
roar of the incoming tide at the mouth of the river
Conway is still called the <q>death-groan of Dylan.</q>
</p>


<pb n='381' id='page381'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Llew Llaw Gyffes</hi>
</p>

<p>
The other infant was seized by Gwydion and brought
up under his protection. Like other solar heroes, he
grew very rapidly; when he was four he was as big as
if he were eight, and the comeliest youth that ever was
seen. One day Gwydion took him to visit his mother
Arianrod. She hated the children who had exposed her
false pretensions, and upbraided Gwydion for bringing
the boy into her sight. <q>What is his name?</q> she asked.
<q>Verily,</q> said Gwydion, <q>he has not yet a name.</q>
<q>Then I lay this destiny upon him,</q> said Arianrod,
<q>that he shall never have a name till one is given him
by me.</q> On this Gwydion went forth in wrath, and
remained in his castle of Caer Dathyl that night.
</p>

<p>
Though the fact does not appear in this tale, it must
be remembered that Gwydion is, in the older mythology,
the father of Arianrod's children.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>How Llew Got his Name</hi>
</p>

<p>
He was resolved to have a name for his son. Next
day he went to the strand below Caer Arianrod,
bringing the boy with him. Here he sat down by
the beach, and in his character of a master of magic
he made himself look like a shoemaker, and the boy
like an apprentice, and he began to make shoes out of
sedges and seaweed, to which he gave the semblance
of Cordovan leather. Word was brought to Arianrod
of the wonderful shoes that were being made by a
strange cobbler, and she sent her measure for a pair.
Gwydion made them too large. She sent it again, and
he made them too small. Then she came herself to
be fitted. While this was going on, a wren came and
lit on the boat's mast, and the boy, taking up a bow,
shot an arrow that transfixed the leg between the sinew
<pb n='382' id='page382'/>
and the bone. Arianrod admired the brilliant shot.
<q>Verily,</q> she said, <q>with a steady hand (<hi rend='italic'>llaw gyffes</hi>)
did the lion (<hi rend='italic'>llew</hi>) hit it.</q> <q>No thanks to thee,</q> cried
Gwydion, <q>now he has got a name. Llew Llaw
Gyffes shall he be called henceforward.</q>
</p>

<p>
We have seen that the name really means the same
thing as the Gaelic Lugh Lamfada, Lugh (Light) of the
Long Arm; so that we have here an instance of a legend
growing up round a misunderstood name inherited from
a half-forgotten mythology.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>How Llew Took Arms</hi>
</p>

<p>
The shoes went back immediately to sedges and seaweed
again, and Arianrod, angry at being tricked, laid
a new curse on the boy. <q>He shall never bear arms
till I invest him with them.</q> But Gwydion, going to
Caer Arianrod with the boy in the semblance of two
bards, makes by magic art the illusion of a foray of
armed men round the castle. Arianrod gives them
weapons to help in the defence, and thus again finds
herself tricked by the superior craft of Gwydion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Flower-Wife of Llew</hi>
</p>

<p>
Next she said, <q>He shall never have a wife of the
race that now inhabits this earth.</q> This raised a difficulty
beyond the powers of even Gwydion, and he went to
Māth, the supreme master of magic. <q>Well,</q> said
Māth, <q>we will seek, I and thou, to form a wife for
him out of flowers.</q> <q>So they took the blossoms of
the oak, and the blossoms of the broom, and the
blossoms of the meadow-sweet, and produced from
them a maiden, the fairest and most graceful that man
ever saw. And they baptized her, and gave her the
name of Blodeuwedd, or Flower-face.</q> They wedded
her to Llew, and gave them the cantrev of Dinodig to
<pb n='383' id='page383'/>
reign over, and there Llew and his bride dwelt for a
season, happy, and beloved by all.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Betrayal of Llew</hi>
</p>

<p>
But Blodeuwedd was not worthy of her beautiful
name and origin. One day when Llew was away on a
visit with Māth, a lord named Gronw Pebyr came
a-hunting by the palace of Llew, and Blodeuwedd
loved him from the moment she looked upon him.
That night they slept together, and the next, and the
next, and then they planned how to be rid of Llew for
ever. But Llew, like the Gothic solar hero Siegfried,
is invulnerable except under special circumstances, and
Blodeuwedd has to learn from him how he may be
slain. This she does under pretence of care for his
welfare. The problem is a hard one. Llew can only
be killed by a spear which has been a year in making,
and has only been worked on during the Sacrifice of
the Host on Sundays. Furthermore, he cannot be
slain within a house or without, on horseback or on
foot. The only way, in fact, is that he should stand
with one foot on a dead buck and the other in a
cauldron, which is to be used for a bath and thatched
with a roof&mdash;if he is wounded while in this position
with a spear made as directed the wound may be fatal,
not otherwise. After a year, during which Gronw
wrought at the spear, Blodeuwedd begged Llew to
show her more fully what she must guard against, and
he took up the required position to please her. Gronw,
lurking in a wood hard by, hurled the deadly spear,
and the head, which was poisoned, sank into Llew's
body, but the shaft broke off. Then Llew changed
into an eagle, and with a loud scream he soared up into
the air and was no more seen, and Gronw took his
castle and lands and added them to his own.
</p>


<pb n='384' id='page384'/>

<p>
These tidings at last reached Gwydion and Māth,
and Gwydion set out to find Llew. He came to the
house of a vassal of his, from whom he learned that a
sow that he had disappeared every day and could not
be traced, but it came home duly each night. Gwydion
followed the sow, and it went far away to the brook
since called Nant y Llew, where it stopped under a tree
and began feeding. Gwydion looked to see what it
ate, and found that it fed on putrid flesh that dropped
from an eagle sitting aloft on the tree, and it seemed
to him that the eagle was Llew. Gwydion sang to it,
and brought it gradually down the tree till it came to
his knee, when he struck it with his magic wand and
restored it to the shape of Llew, but worn to skin and
bone&mdash;<q>no one ever saw a more piteous sight.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Healing of Llew</hi>
</p>

<p>
When Llew was healed, he and Gwydion took vengeance
on their foes. Blodeuwedd was changed into
an owl and bidden to shun the light of day, and Gronw
was slain by a cast of the spear of Llew that passed
through a slab of stone to reach him, and the slab with
the hole through it made by the spear of Llew remains
by the bank of the river Cynvael in Ardudwy to this
day. And Llew took possession, for the second time,
of his lands, and ruled them prosperously all his days.
</p>

<p>
The four preceding tales are called the Four
Branches of the Mabinogi, and of the collection called
the <q>Mabinogion</q> they form the most ancient and
important part.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Dream of Maxen Wledig</hi>
</p>

<p>
Following the order of the tales in the <q>Mabinogion,</q>
as presented in Mr. Nutt's edition, we come
next to one which is a pure work of invention, with no
<pb n='385' id='page385'/>
mythical or legendary element at all. It recounts how
Maxen Wledig, Emperor of Rome, had a vivid dream,
in which he was led into a strange country, where he
saw a king in an ivory chair carving chessmen with a
steel file from a rod of gold. By him, on a golden
throne, was the fairest of maidens he had ever beheld.
Waking, he found himself in love with the dream-maiden,
and sent messengers far and wide to discover,
if they could, the country and people that had appeared
to him. They were found in Britain. Thither went
Maxen, and wooed and wedded the maiden. In his
absence a usurper laid hold of his empire in Rome, but
with the aid of his British friends he reconquered his
dominions, and many of them settled there with him,
while others went home to Britain. The latter took
with them foreign wives, but, it is said, cut out their
tongues, lest they should corrupt the speech of the
Britons. Thus early and thus powerful was the devotion
to their tongue of the Cymry, of whom the mythical
bard Taliesin prophesied:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Their God they will praise,</q></l>
<l>Their speech they will keep,</l>
<l>Their land they will lose,</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'><q rend='pre: none'>Except wild Walia.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Story of Lludd and Llevelys</hi>
</p>

<p>
This tale is associated with the former one in the
section entitled Romantic British History. It tells how
Lludd son of Beli, and his brother Llevelys, ruled
respectively over Britain and France, and how Lludd
sought his brother's aid to stay the three plagues that
were harassing the land. These three plagues were,
first, the presence of a demoniac race called the
Coranians; secondly, a fearful scream that was heard
in every home in Britain on every May-eve, and
<pb n='386' id='page386'/>
scared the people out of their senses; thirdly, the
unaccountable disappearance of all provisions in the
king's court every night, so that nothing that was
not consumed by the household could be found the
next morning. Lludd and Llevelys talked over these
matters through a brazen tube, for the Coranians could
hear everything that was said if once the winds got
hold of it&mdash;a property also attributed to Māth, son of
Māthonwy. Llevelys destroyed the Coranians by giving
to Lludd a quantity of poisonous insects which were
to be bruised up and scattered over the people at an
assembly. These insects would slay the Coranians,
but the people of Britain would be immune to them.
The scream Llevelys explained as proceeding from
two dragons, which fought each other once a year.
They were to be slain by being intoxicated with mead,
which was to be placed in a pit dug in the very centre
of Britain, which was found on measurement to be at
Oxford. The provisions, said Llevelys, were taken
away by a giant wizard, for whom Lludd watched as
directed, and overcame him in combat, and made him
his faithful vassal thenceforward. Thus Lludd and
Llevelys freed the island from its three plagues.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Tales of Arthur</hi>
</p>

<p>
We next come to five Arthurian tales, one of which,
the tale of Kilhwch and Olwen, is the only native
Arthurian legend which has come down to us in
Welsh literature. The rest, as we have seen, are more
or less reflections from the Arthurian literature as
developed by foreign hands on the Continent.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Kilhwch and Olwen</hi>
</p>

<p>
Kilhwch was son to Kilydd and his wife Goleuddydd,
and is said to have been cousin to Arthur. His mother
<pb n='387' id='page387'/>
having died, Kilydd took another wife, and she, jealous
of her stepson, laid on him a quest which promised to
be long and dangerous. <q>I declare,</q> she said, <q>that it is
thy destiny</q>&mdash;the Gael would have said <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>geis</foreign>&mdash;<q>not to
be suited with a wife till thou obtain Olwen daughter of
Yspaddaden Penkawr.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>Hawthorn, King of the Giants.</q>
</p></note> And Kilhwch reddened at the
name, and <q>love of the maiden diffused itself through
all his frame.</q> By his father's advice he set out to
Arthur's Court to learn how and where he might find
and woo her.
</p>

<p>
A brilliant passage then describes the youth in the
flower of his beauty, on a noble steed caparisoned with
gold, and accompanied by two brindled white-breasted
greyhounds with collars of rubies, setting forth on his
journey to King Arthur. <q>And the blade of grass bent
not beneath him, so light was his courser's tread.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Kilhwch at Arthur's Court</hi>
</p>

<p>
After some difficulties with the Porter and with
Arthur's seneschal, Kai, who did not wish to admit
the lad while the company were sitting at meat, Kilhwch
was brought into the presence of the King, and declared
his name and his desire. <q>I seek this boon,</q> he said,
<q>from thee and likewise at the hands of thy warriors,</q>
and he then enumerates an immense list full of mythological
personages and details&mdash;Bedwyr, Gwyn ap Nudd,
Kai, Manawyddan,<note place='foot'><p>
The gods of the family of Dōn are thus conceived as servitors to
Arthur, who in this story is evidently the god Artaius.
</p></note> Geraint, and many others, including
<q>Morvran son of Tegid, whom no one struck at in the
battle of Camlan by reason of his ugliness; all thought
he was a devil,</q> and <q>Sandde Bryd Angel, whom no one
touched with a spear in the battle of Camlan because of
his beauty; all thought he was a ministering angel.</q>
<pb n='388' id='page388'/>
The list extends to many scores of names and includes
many women, as, for instance, <q>Creiddylad
the daughter of Lludd of the Silver Hand&mdash;she was
the most splendid maiden in the three Islands of the
Mighty, and for her Gwythyr the son of Greidawl and
Gwyn the son of Nudd fight every first of May till
doom,</q> and the two Iseults and Arthur's Queen,
Gwenhwyvar. <q>All these did Kilydd's son Kilhwch
adjure to obtain his boon.</q>
</p>

<p>
Arthur, however, had never heard of Olwen nor of
her kindred. He promised to seek for her, but at the
end of a year no tidings of her could be found, and
Kilhwch declared that he would depart and leave Arthur
shamed. Kai and Bedwyr, with the guide Kynddelig,
are at last bidden to go forth on the quest.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Servitors of Arthur</hi>
</p>

<p>
These personages are very different from those who
are called by the same names in Malory or Tennyson.
Kai, it is said, could go nine days under water. He
could render himself at will as tall as a forest tree. So
hot was his physical constitution that nothing he bore
in his hand could get wetted in the heaviest rain.
<q>Very subtle was Kai.</q> As for Bedwyr&mdash;the later Sir
Bedivere&mdash;we are told that none equalled him in swiftness,
and that, though one-armed, he was a match for any
three warriors on the field of battle; his lance made a
wound equal to those of nine. Besides these three there
went also on the quest Gwrhyr, who knew all tongues,
and Gwalchmai son of Arthur's sister Gwyar, and Menw,
who could make the party invisible by magic spells.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Custennin</hi>
</p>

<p>
The party journeyed till at last they came to a great
castle before which was a flock of sheep kept by a
<pb n='389' id='page389'/>
shepherd who had by him a mastiff big as a horse.
The breath of this shepherd, we are told, could burn
up a tree. <q>He let no occasion pass without doing
some hurt or harm.</q> However, he received the party
well, told them that he was Custennin, brother of
Yspaddaden whose castle stood before them, and
brought them home to his wife. The wife turned out
to be a sister of Kilhwch's mother Goleuddydd, and she
was rejoiced at seeing her nephew, but sorrowful at the
thought that he had come in search of Olwen, <q>for
none ever returned from that quest alive.</q> Custennin
and his family, it appears, have suffered much at the
hands of Yspaddaden&mdash;all their sons but one being
slain, because Yspaddaden envied his brother his share
of their patrimony. So they associated themselves
with the heroes in their quest.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Olwen of the White Track</hi>
</p>

<p>
Next day Olwen came down to the herdsman's house
as usual, for she was wont to wash her hair there every
Saturday, and each time she did so she left all her
rings in the vessel and never sent for them again. She
is described in one of those pictorial passages in which
the Celtic passion for beauty has found such exquisite
utterance.
</p>

<p>
<q>The maiden was clothed in a robe of flame-coloured
silk, and about her neck was a collar of ruddy gold on
which were precious emeralds and rubies. More yellow
was her head than the flower of the broom, and her
skin was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer
were her hands and her fingers than the blossoms of
the wood-anemone amidst the spray of the meadow
fountain. The eye of the trained hawk, the glance of
the three-mewed falcon, was not brighter than hers.
<pb n='390' id='page390'/>
Her bosom was more snowy than the breast of the
white swan, her cheek was redder than the reddest
roses. Whoso beheld her was filled with her love.
Four white trefoils sprang up wherever she trod. And
therefore was she called Olwen.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>She of the White Track.</q> Compare the description of Etain,
pp. <ref target='page158'>157</ref>, <ref target='page158'>158</ref>.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
Kilhwch and she conversed together and loved each
other, and she bade him go and ask her of her father
and deny him nothing that he might demand. She had
pledged her faith not to wed without his will, for his
life would only last till the time of her espousals.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Yspaddaden</hi>
</p>

<p>
Next day the party went to the castle and saw
Yspaddaden. He put them off with various excuses, and
as they left flung after them a poisoned dart. Bedwyr
caught it and flung it back, wounding him in the knee,
and Yspaddaden cursed him in language of extraordinary
vigour; the words seem to crackle and spit like
flame. Thrice over this happened, and at last Yspaddaden
declared what must be done to win Olwen.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tasks of Kilhwch</hi>
</p>

<p>
A long series of tasks follows. A vast hill is to be
ploughed, sown, and reaped in one day; only Amathaon
son of Dōn can do it, and he will not. Govannon, the
smith, is to rid the ploughshare at each headland, and
he will not do it. The two dun oxen of Gwlwlyd are
to draw the plough, and he will not lend them. Honey
nine times sweeter than that of the bee must be got to
make bragget for the wedding feast. A magic cauldron,
a magic basket out of which comes any meat that a man
desires, a magic horn, the sword of Gwrnach the Giant&mdash;all
<pb n='391' id='page391'/>
these must be won; and many other secret and
difficult things, some forty in all, before Kilhwch can
call Olwen his own. The most difficult quest is that of
obtaining the comb and scissors that are between the
two ears of Twrch Trwyth, a king transformed into a
monstrous boar. To hunt the boar a number of other
quests must be accomplished&mdash;the whelp of Greid son
of Eri is to be won, and a certain leash to hold him,
and a certain collar for the leash, and a chain for the
collar, and Mabon son of Modron for the huntsman
and the horse of Gweddw to carry Mabon, and Gwyn
son of Nudd to help, <q>whom God placed over the
brood of devils in Annwn ... he will never be spared
them,</q> and so forth to an extent which makes the famous
<hi rend='italic'>eric</hi> of the sons of Turenn seem trifling by comparison.
<q>Difficulties shalt thou meet with, and nights without
sleep, in seeking this [bride price], and if thou obtain it
not, neither shalt thou have my daughter.</q> Kilhwch
has one answer for every demand: <q>It will be easy for
me to accomplish this, although thou mayest think that
it will not be easy. And I shall gain thy daughter and
thou shalt lose thy life.</q>
</p>

<p>
So they depart on their way to fulfil the tasks, and
on their way home they fall in with Gwrnach the Giant,
whose sword Kai, pretending to be a sword-polisher,
obtains by a stratagem. On reaching Arthur's Court
again, and telling the King what they have to do, he
promises his aid. First of the marvels they accomplished
was the discovery and liberation of Mabon son
of Modron, <q>who was taken from his mother when
three nights old, and it is not known where he is now,
nor whether he is living or dead.</q> Gwrhyr inquires of
him from the Ousel of Cilgwri, who is so old that a
smith's anvil on which he was wont to peck has been
worn to the size of a nut, yet he has never heard of
<pb n='392' id='page392'/>
Mabon. But he takes them to a beast older still, the
Stag of Redynvre, and so on to the Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd,
and the Eagle of Gwern Abwy, and the Salmon of Llyn
Llyw, the oldest of living things, and at last they find
Mabon imprisoned in the stone dungeon of Gloucester,
and with Arthur's help they release him, and so the
second task is fulfilled. In one way or another, by
stratagem, or valour, or magic art, every achievement
is accomplished, including the last and most perilous
one, that of obtaining <q>the blood of the black witch
Orddu, daughter of the white witch Orwen, of Penn
Nart Govid on the confines of Hell.</q> The combat
here is very like that of Finn in the cave of Keshcorran,
but Arthur at last cleaves the hag in twain, and Kaw of
North Britain takes her blood.
</p>

<p>
So then they set forth for the castle of Yspaddaden
again, and he acknowledges defeat. Goreu son of
Custennin cuts off his head, and that night Olwen
became the happy bride of Kilhwch, and the hosts of
Arthur dispersed, every man to his own land.

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Dream of Rhonabwy</hi>
</p>

<p>
Rhonabwy was a man-at-arms under Madawc son of
Maredudd, whose brother Iorwerth rose in rebellion
against him; and Rhonabwy went with the troops of
Madawc to put him down. Going with a few companions
into a mean hut to rest for the night, he lies
down to sleep on a yellow calf-skin by the fire, while
his friends lie on filthy couches of straw and twigs. On
the calf-skin he has a wonderful dream. He sees before
him the court and camp of Arthur&mdash;here the <hi rend='italic'>quasi</hi>-historical
king, neither the legendary deity of the former
tale nor the Arthur of the French chivalrous romances&mdash;as
he moves towards Mount Badon for his great
battle with the heathen. A character named Iddawc is
<pb n='393' id='page393'/>
his guide to the King, who smiles at Rhonabwy and
his friends, and asks: <q>Where, Iddawc, didst thou find
these little men?</q> <q>I found them, lord, up yonder
on the road.</q> <q>It pitieth me,</q> said Arthur, <q>that
men of such stature as these should have the island in
their keeping, after the men that guarded it of yore.</q>
Rhonabwy has his attention directed to a stone in the
King's ring. <q>It is one of the properties of that stone
to enable thee to remember that which thou seest here
to-night, and hadst thou not seen the stone, thou
wouldst never have been able to remember aught
thereof.</q>
</p>

<p>
The different heroes and companions that compose
Arthur's army are minutely described, with all the
brilliant colour and delicate detail so beloved by the
Celtic fabulist. The chief incident narrated is a game
of chess that takes place between Arthur and the knight
Owain son of Urien. While the game goes on, first
the knights of Arthur harry and disturb the Ravens of
Owain, but Arthur, when Owain complains, only says:
<q>Play thy game.</q> Afterwards the Ravens have the
better of it, and it is Owain's turn to bid Arthur attend
to his game. Then Arthur took the golden chessmen
and crushed them to dust in his hand, and besought
Owain to quiet his Ravens, which was done, and peace
reigned again. Rhonabwy, it is said, slept three days
and nights on the calf-skin before awaking from his
wondrous dream. An epilogue declares that no bard
is expected to know this tale by heart and without a
book, <q>because of the various colours that were upon
the horses, and the many wondrous colours of the arms
and of the panoply, and of the precious scarfs, and of
the virtue-bearing stones.</q> The <q>Dream of Rhonabwy</q>
is rather a gorgeous vision of the past than a
story in the ordinary sense of the word.

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Lady of the Fountain</hi>
</p>

<p>
We have here a Welsh reproduction of the <hi rend='italic'>Conte</hi>
entitled <q>Le Chevalier au lion</q> of Chrestien de
Troyes. The principal personage in the tale is Owain
son of Urien, who appears in a character as foreign to
the spirit of Celtic legend as it was familiar on the
Continent, that of knight-errant.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Adventure of Kymon</hi>
</p>

<p>
We are told in the introduction that Kymon, a
knight of Arthur's Court, had a strange and unfortunate
adventure. Riding forth in search of some
deed of chivalry to do, he came to a splendid castle,
where he was hospitably received by four-and-twenty
damsels, of whom <q>the least lovely was more lovely
than Gwenhwyvar, the wife of Arthur, when she has
appeared loveliest at the Offering on the Day of the
Nativity, or at the feast of Easter.</q> With them was
a noble lord, who, after Kymon had eaten, asked of
his business. Kymon explained that he was seeking
for his match in combat. The lord of the castle smiled,
and bade him proceed as follows: He should take the
road up the valley and through a forest till he came to
a glade with a mound in the midst of it. On the
mound he would see a black man of huge stature with
one foot and one eye, bearing a mighty iron club.
He was wood-ward of that forest, and would have
thousands of wild animals, stags, serpents, and what
not, feeding around him. He would show Kymon
what he was in quest of.
</p>

<p>
Kymon followed the instructions, and the black man
directed him to where he should find a fountain under
a great tree; by the side of it would be a silver bowl
on a slab of marble. Kymon was to take the bowl and
<pb n='395' id='page395'/>
throw a bowlful of water on the slab, when a terrific
storm of hail and thunder would follow&mdash;then there
would break forth an enchanting music of singing birds&mdash;then
would appear a knight in black armour riding
on a coal-black horse, with a black pennon upon his
lance. <q>And if thou dost not find trouble in that
adventure, thou needst not seek it during the rest of
thy life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Character of Welsh Romance</hi>
</p>

<p>
Here let us pause for a moment to point out how
clearly we are in the region of medi&aelig;val romance, and
how far from that of Celtic mythology. Perhaps the
Celtic <q>Land of Youth</q> may have remotely suggested
those regions of beauty and mystery into which the
Arthurian knight rides in quest of adventure. But
the scenery, the motives, the incidents, are altogether
different. And how beautiful they are&mdash;how steeped
in the magic light of romance! The colours live and
glow, the forest murmurs in our ears, the breath of
that springtime of our modern world is about us, as
we follow the lonely rider down the grassy track into
an unknown world of peril and delight. While in
some respects the Continental tales are greater than the
Welsh, more thoughtful, more profound, they do not
approach them in the exquisite artistry with which the
exterior aspect of things is rendered, the atmosphere
of enchantment maintained, and the reader led, with
ever-quickening interest, from point to point in the
development of the tale. Nor are these Welsh tales
a whit behind in the noble and chivalrous spirit
which breathes through them. A finer school of
character and of manners could hardly be found in
literature. How strange that for many centuries this
treasure beyond all price should have lain unnoticed in
<pb n='396' id='page396'/>
our midst! And how deep must be our gratitude
to the nameless bards whose thought created it, and to
the nobly inspired hand which first made it a possession
for all the English-speaking world!
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Defeat of Kymon</hi>
</p>

<p>
But to resume our story. Kymon did as he was
bidden, the Black Knight appeared, silently they set
lance in rest and charged. Kymon was flung to earth,
while his enemy, not bestowing one glance upon him,
passed the shaft of his lance through the rein of Kymon's
horse and rode off with it in the direction whence he
had come. Kymon went back afoot to the castle, where
none asked him how he had sped, but they gave him a
new horse, <q>a dark bay palfrey with nostrils as red as
scarlet,</q> on which he rode home to Caerleon.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Owain and the Black Knight</hi>
</p>

<p>
Owain was, of course, fired by the tale of Kymon, and
next morning at the dawn of day he rode forth to seek
for the same adventure. All passed as it had done in
Kymon's case, but Owain wounded the Black Knight so
sorely that he turned his horse and fled, Owain pursuing
him hotly. They came to a <q>vast and resplendent
castle.</q> Across the drawbridge they rode, the outer
portcullis of which fell as the Black Knight passed it.
But so close at his heels was Owain that the portcullis
fell behind him, cutting his horse in two behind the
saddle, and he himself remained imprisoned between
the outer gate of the drawbridge and the inner. While
he was in this predicament a maiden came to him and
gave him a ring. When he wore it with the stone
reversed and clenched in his hand he would become
invisible, and when the servants of the lord of the castle
came for him he was to elude them and follow her.
</p>


<pb n='397' id='page397'/>

<p>
This she did knowing apparently who he was, <q>for as
a friend thou art the most sincere, and as a lover the
most devoted.</q>
</p>

<p>
Owain did as he was bidden, and the maiden concealed
him. In that night a great lamentation was heard in
the castle&mdash;its lord had died of the wound which Owain
had given him. Soon afterwards Owain got sight of the
mistress of the castle, and love of her took entire
possession of him. Luned, the maiden who had rescued
him, wooed her for him, and he became her husband,
and lord of the Castle of the Fountain and all the
dominions of the Black Knight. And he then defended
the fountain with lance and sword as his forerunner
had done, and made his defeated antagonists ransom
themselves for great sums, which he bestowed among
his barons and knights. Thus he abode for three
years.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Search for Owain</hi>
</p>

<p>
After this time Arthur, with his nephew Gwalchmai
and with Kymon for guide, rode forth at the head of a
host to search for tidings of Owain. They came to the
fountain, and here they met Owain, neither knowing the
other as their helms were down. And first Kai was
overthrown, and then Gwalchmai and Owain fought,
and after a while Gwalchmai was unhelmed. Owain
said, <q>My lord Gwalchmai, I did not know thee; take
my sword and my arms.</q> Said Gwalchmai, <q>Thou,
Owain, art the victor; take thou my sword.</q> Arthur
ended the contention in courtesy by taking the swords
of both, and then they all rode to the Castle of the
Fountain, where Owain entertained them with great joy.
And he went back with Arthur to Caerleon, promising
to his countess that he would remain there but three
months and then return.
</p>


<pb n='398' id='page398'/>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Owain Forgets his Lady</hi>
</p>

<p>
But at the Court of Arthur he forgot his love and his
duty, and remained there three years. At the end of that
time a noble lady came riding upon a horse caparisoned
with gold, and she sought out Owain and took the ring
from his hand. <q>Thus,</q> she said, <q>shall be treated the
deceiver, the traitor, the faithless, the disgraced, and the
beardless.</q> Then she turned her horse's head and
departed. And Owain, overwhelmed with shame and
remorse, fled from the sight of men and lived in a
desolate country with wild beasts till his body wasted
and his hair grew long and his clothing rotted away.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Owain and the Lion</hi>
</p>

<p>
In this guise, when near to death from exposure and
want, he was taken in by a certain widowed countess
and her maidens, and restored to strength by magic
balsams; and although they besought him to remain
with them, he rode forth again, seeking for lonely and
desert lands. Here he found a lion in battle with a
great serpent. Owain slew the serpent, and the lion
followed him and played about him as if it had been a
greyhound that he had reared. And it fed him by
catching deer, part of which Owain cooked for himself,
giving the rest to his lion to devour; and the beast
kept watch over him by night.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Release of Luned</hi>
</p>

<p>
Owain next finds an imprisoned damsel, whose sighs
he hears, though he cannot see her nor she him. Being
questioned, she told him that her name was Luned&mdash;she
was the handmaid of a countess whose husband had
left her, <q>and he was the friend I loved best in the
world.</q> Two of the pages of the countess had traduced
<pb n='399' id='page399'/>
him, and because she defended him she was condemned
to be burned if before a year was out he (namely, Owain
son of Urien) had not appeared to deliver her. And
the year would end to-morrow. On the next day Owain
met the two youths leading Luned to execution and did
battle with them. With the help of the lion he overcame
them, rescued Luned, and returned to the Castle
of the Fountain, where he was reconciled with his love.
And he took her with him to Arthur's Court, and she
was his wife there as long as she lived. Lastly comes
an adventure in which, still aided by the lion, he vanquishes
a black giant and releases four-and-twenty noble
ladies, and the giant vows to give up his evil ways and
keep a hospice for wayfarers as long as he should live.
</p>

<p>
<q>And thenceforth Owain dwelt at Arthur's Court,
greatly beloved, as the head of his household, until he
went away with his followers; and these were the army
of three hundred ravens which Kenverchyn<note place='foot'><p>
There is no other mention of this Kenverchyn or of how Owain
got his raven-army, also referred to in <q>The Dream of Rhonabwy.</q>
We have here evidently a piece of antique mythology embedded in
a more modern fabric.

him. And wherever Owain went with these he was victorious.
And this is the tale of the Lady of the Fountain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tale of Enid and Geraint</hi>
</p>

<p>
In this tale, which appears to be based on the
<q>Erec</q> of Chrestien de Troyes, the main interest is
neither mythological nor adventurous, but sentimental.
How Geraint found and wooed his love as the daughter
of a great lord fallen on evil days; how he jousted for
her with Edeyrn, son of Nudd&mdash;a Cymric deity transformed
into the <q>Knight of the Sparrowhawk</q>; how,
lapped in love of her, he grew careless of his fame
and his duty; how he misunderstood the words she
<pb n='400' id='page400'/>
murmured over him as she deemed him sleeping, and
doubted her faith; how despitefully he treated her;
and in how many a bitter test she proved her love
and loyalty&mdash;all these things have been made so
familiar to English readers in Tennyson's <q>Enid</q>
that they need not detain us here. Tennyson, in
this instance, has followed his original very closely.
</p>

<p>
Legends of the Grail: The Tale of Peredur
</p>

<p>
The Tale of Peredur is one of great interest and
significance in connexion with the origin of the Grail
legend. Peredur corresponds to the Perceval of
Chrestien de Troyes, to whom we owe the earliest
extant poem on the Grail; but that writer left his
Grail story unfinished, and we never learn from him
what exactly the Grail was or what gave it its importance.
When we turn for light to <q>Peredur,</q>
which undoubtedly represents a more ancient form of
the legend, we find ourselves baffled. For <q>Peredur</q>
may be described as the Grail story without the Grail.<note place='foot'><p>
Like the Breton Tale of <q>Peronnik the Fool,</q> translated in
<q>Le Foyer Bréton,</q> by Emile Souvestre. The syllable <hi rend='italic'>Per</hi> which
occurs in all forms of the hero's name means in Welsh and Cornish
a bowl or vessel (Irish <foreign lang='ga' rend='italic'>coire</foreign>&mdash;see <ref target='p35n1'>p. 35, note</ref>). No satisfactory derivation
has in any case been found of the latter part of the name.
</p></note>
The strange personages, objects, and incidents which
form the usual setting for the entry upon the scene of
this mystic treasure are all here; we <corr sic='breath'>breathe</corr> the very
atmosphere of the Grail Castle; but of the Grail itself
there is no word. The story is concerned simply with
the vengeance taken by the hero for the slaying of a
kinsman, and for this end only are the mysteries of the
Castle of Wonders displayed to him.
</p>

<p>
We learn at the opening of the tale that Peredur was
in the significant position of being a seventh son. To
be a seventh son was, in this world of mystical romance,
<pb n='401' id='page401'/>
equivalent to being marked out by destiny for fortunes
high and strange. His father, Evrawc, an earl of the
North, and his six brothers had fallen in fight.
Peredur's mother, therefore, fearing a similar fate for
her youngest child, brought him up in a forest, keeping
from him all knowledge of chivalry or warfare and of
such things as war-horses or weapons. Here he grew
up a simple rustic in manner and in knowledge, but of
an amazing bodily strength and activity.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>He Goes Forth in Quest of Adventure</hi>
</p>

<p>
One day he saw three knights on the borders of the
forest. They were all of Arthur's Court&mdash;Gwalchmai,
Geneir, and Owain. Entranced by the sight, he
asked his mother what these beings were. <q>They
are angels, my son,</q> said she. <q>By my faith,</q> said
Peredur, <q>I will go and become an angel with them.</q>
He goes to meet them, and soon learns what they are.
Owain courteously explains to him the use of a saddle,
a shield, a sword, all the accoutrements of warfare;
and Peredur that evening picked out a bony piebald
draught-horse, and dressed him up in a saddle and
trappings made of twigs, and imitated from those he
had seen. Seeing that he was bent on going forth to
deeds of chivalry, his mother gave him her blessing
and sundry instructions, and bade him seek the Court
of Arthur; <q>there there are the best, and the boldest,
and the most beautiful of men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>His First Feat of Arms</hi>
</p>

<p>
Peredur mounted his Rosinante, took for weapons
a handful of sharp-pointed stakes, and rode forth
to Arthur's Court. Here the steward, Kai, rudely
repulsed him for his rustic appearance, but a dwarf
and dwarfess, who had been a year at the Court
<pb n='402' id='page402'/>
without speaking one word to any one there, cried:
<q>Goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc; the welcome of
Heaven be unto thee, flower of knights and light of
chivalry.</q> Kai chastised the dwarfs for breaking
silence by lauding such a fellow as Peredur, and
when the latter demanded to be brought to Arthur,
bade him first go and overcome a stranger knight who
had just challenged the whole Court by throwing a
goblet of wine into the face of Gwenhwyvar, and whom
all shrank from meeting. Peredur went out promptly
to where the ruffian knight was swaggering up and
down, awaiting an opponent, and in the combat that
ensued pierced his skull with one of his sharp stakes
and slew him. Owain then came out and found
Peredur dragging his fallen enemy about. <q>What
art thou doing there?</q> said Owain. <q>This iron coat,</q>
said Peredur, <q>will never come off from him; not by
my efforts at any rate.</q> So Owain showed him how to
unfasten the armour, and Peredur took it, and the
knight's weapons and horse, and rode forth to seek what
further adventures might befall.
</p>

<p>
Here we have the character of <hi rend='italic'>der reine Thor</hi>, the valiant
and pure-hearted simpleton, clearly and vividly drawn.
</p>

<p>
Peredur on leaving Arthur's Court had many encounters
in which he triumphed with ease, sending the
beaten knights to Caerleon-on-Usk with the message
that he had overthrown them for the honour of Arthur
and in his service, but that he, Peredur, would never
come to the Court again till he had avenged the insult
to the dwarfs upon Kai, who was accordingly reproved
by Arthur and was greatly grieved thereat.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Castle of Wonders</hi>
</p>

<p>
We now come into what the reader will immediately
recognise as the atmosphere of the Grail legend. Peredur
<pb n='403' id='page403'/>
came to a castle beside a lake, where he found a venerable
man with attendants about him who were fishing in the
lake. As Peredur approached, the aged man rose and
went into the castle, and Peredur saw that he was lame.
Peredur entered, and was hospitably received in a great
hall. The aged man asked him, when they had done
their meal, if he knew how to fight with the sword, and
promised to teach him all knightly accomplishments,
and <q>the manners and customs of different countries,
and courtesy and gentleness and noble bearing.</q> And
he added: <q>I am thy uncle, thy mother's brother.</q>
Finally, he bade him ride forth, and remember, whatever
he saw that might cause him wonder, not to ask the
meaning of it if no one had the courtesy to inform him.
This is the test of obedience and self-restraint on which
the rest of the adventure turns.
</p>

<p>
On next riding forth, Peredur came to a vast desert
wood, beyond which he found a great castle, the Castle
of Wonders. He entered it by the open door, and
found a stately, hoary-headed man sitting in a great hall
with many pages about him, who received Peredur
honourably. At meat Peredur sat beside the lord of
the castle, who asked him, when they had done, if he
could fight with a sword. <q>Were I to receive instruction,</q>
said Peredur, <q>I think I could.</q> The lord then
gave Peredur a sword, and bade him strike at a great
iron staple that was in the floor. Peredur did so, and
cut the staple in two, but the sword also flew into two
parts. <q>Place the two parts together,</q> said the lord.
Peredur did so, and they became one again, both sword
and staple. A second time this was done with the same
result. The third time neither sword nor staple would
reunite.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast arrived,</q> said the lord, <q>at two-thirds
of thy strength.</q> He then declared that he also was
</p>


<pb n='404' id='page404'/>

<p>
Peredur's uncle, and brother to the fisher-lord with
whom Peredur had lodged on the previous night. As
they discoursed, two youths entered the hall bearing a
spear of mighty size, from the point of which three
streams of blood dropped upon the ground, and all the
company when they saw this began wailing and lamenting
with a great outcry, but the lord took no notice and
did not break off his discourse with Peredur. Next
there came in two maidens carrying between them a
large salver, on which, amid a profusion of blood, lay a
man's head. Thereupon the wailing and lamenting
began even more loudly than before. But at last they
fell silent, and Peredur was led off to his chamber.
Mindful of the injunction of the fisher-lord, he had
shown no surprise at what he saw, nor had he asked
the meaning of it. He then rode forth again in quest
of other adventures, which he had in bewildering abundance,
and which have no particular relation to the main
theme. The mystery of the castle is not revealed till
the last pages of the story. The head in the silver dish
was that of a cousin of Peredur's. The lance was the
weapon with which he was slain, and with which also
the uncle of Peredur, the fisher-lord, had been lamed.
Peredur had been shown these things to incite him to
avenge the wrong, and to prove his fitness for the task.
The <q>nine sorceresses of Gloucester</q> are said to have
been those who worked these evils on the relatives of
Peredur. On learning these matters Peredur, with the
help of Arthur, attacked the sorceresses, who were slain
every one, and the vengeance was accomplished.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Conte del Graal</hi>
</p>

<p>
The tale of Chrestien de Troyes called the <q>Conte
del Graal</q> or <q>Perceval le Gallois</q> launched the story
in European literature. It was written about the year
<pb n='405' id='page405'/>
1180. It agrees in the introductory portion with
<q>Peredur,</q> the hero being here called Perceval. He
is trained in knightly accomplishments by an aged
knight named Gonemans, who warns him against
talking overmuch and asking questions. When he
comes to the Castle of Wonders the objects brought
into the hall are a blood-dripping lance, a <q>graal</q>
accompanied by two double-branched candlesticks, the
light of which is put out by the shining of the graal, a
silver plate and sword, the last of which is given to
Perceval. The bleeding head of the Welsh story does
not appear, nor are we told what the graal was. Next
day when Perceval rode forth he met a maiden who
upbraided him fiercely for not having asked the meaning
of what he saw&mdash;had he done so the lame king (who is
here identical with the lord of the Castle of Wonders)
would have been made whole again. Perceval's sin in
quitting his mother against her wish was the reason why
he was withholden from asking the question which would
have broken the spell. This is a very crude piece of
invention, for it was manifestly Peredur's destiny to
take arms and achieve the adventure of the Grail, and
he committed no sin in doing so. Later on in the story
Perceval is met by a damsel of hideous appearance,
who curses him for his omission to ask concerning the
lance and the other wonders&mdash;had he done so the king
would have been restored and would have ruled his
land in peace, but now maidens will be put to shame,
knights will be slain, widows and orphans will be
made.
</p>

<p>
This conception of the question episode seems to me
radically different from that which was adopted in the
Welsh version. It is characteristic of Peredur that he
always does as he is told by proper authority. The
question was a test of obedience and self-restraint, and
<pb n='406' id='page406'/>
he succeeded in the ordeal. In fairy literature one is
often punished for curiosity, but never for discretion
and reserve. The Welsh tale here preserves, I think,
the original form of the story. But the French writers
mistook the omission to ask questions for a failure on
the part of the hero, and invented a shallow and incongruous
theory of the episode and its consequences.
Strange to say, however, the French view found its way
into later versions of the Welsh tale, and such a version
is that which we have in the <q>Mabinogion.</q> Peredur,
towards the end of the story, meets with a hideous
damsel, the terrors of whose aspect are vividly described,
and who rebukes him violently for not having asked the
meaning of the marvels at the castle: <q>Hadst thou
done so the king would have been restored to health,
and his dominions to peace. Whereas from henceforth
he will have to endure battles and conflicts, and his
knights will perish, and wives will be widowed, and
maidens will be left portionless, and all this is because
of thee.</q> I regard this loathly damsel as an obvious
interpolation in the Welsh tale. She came into it
straight out of the pages of Chrestien. That she did
not originally belong to the story of Peredur seems
evident from the fact that in this tale the lame lord who
bids Peredur refrain from asking questions is, according
to the damsel, the very person who would have benefited
by his doing so. As a matter of fact, Peredur never
does ask the question, and it plays no part in the conclusion
of the story.
</p>

<p>
Chrestien's unfinished tale tells us some further
adventures of Perceval and of his friend and fellow-knight,
Gauvain, but never explains the significance of
the mysterious objects seen at the castle. His continuators,
of whom Gautier was the first, tell us that
the Graal was the Cup of the Last Supper and the lance
<pb n='407' id='page407'/>
that which had pierced the side of Christ at the Crucifixion;
and that Peredur ultimately makes his way back
to the castle, asks the necessary question, and succeeds his
uncle as lord of the castle and guardian of its treasures.

In the story as given by Wolfram von Eschenbach,
who wrote about the year 1200&mdash;some twenty years
later than Chrestien de Troyes, with whose work he
was acquainted&mdash;we meet with a new and unique conception
of the Grail. He says of the knights of the
Grail Castle:
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend='post: none'>Si lebent von einem steine</q></l>
<l>Des geslähte ist vîl reine . . .</l>
<l>Es heizet <hi rend='italic'>lapsit [lapis] exillîs</hi>,</l>
<l><q rend='pre: none'>Der stein ist ouch genannt der Grâl.</q><note place='foot'><p>
<q>They are nourished by a stone of most noble nature ... it
is called <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>lapsit exillîs</foreign>; the stone is also called the Grail.</q> The term
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>lapsit exillîs</foreign> appears to be a corruption for <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>lapis ex celis</foreign>, <q>the stone
from heaven.</q>
</p></note></l>
</lg>

<p>
It was originally brought down from heaven by a
flight of angels and deposited in Anjou, as the worthiest
region for its reception. Its power is sustained by a
dove which every Good Friday comes from heaven and
lays on the Grail a consecrated Host. It is preserved
in the Castle of Munsalväsche [Montsalvat] and guarded
by four hundred knights, who are all, except their king,
vowed to virginity. The king may marry, and is
indeed, in order to maintain the succession, commanded
to do so by the Grail, which conveys its messages to
mankind by writing which appears upon it and which
fades away when deciphered. In the time of Parzival
the king is Anfortas. He cannot die in presence of
the Grail, but he suffers from a wound which, because
he received it in the cause of worldly pride and in
<pb n='408' id='page408'/>
seeking after illicit love, the influence of the Grail
cannot heal until the destined deliverer shall break the
spell. This Parzival should have done by asking the
question, <q>What aileth thee, uncle?</q> The French
version makes Perceval fail in curiosity&mdash;Wolfram conceives
the failure as one in sympathy. He fails, at any
rate, and next morning finds the castle empty and his
horse standing ready for him at the gate; as he departs
he is mocked by servitors who appear at the windows
of the towers. After many adventures, which are quite
unlike those either in Chrestien's <q>Conte del Graal</q>
or in <q>Peredur,</q> Parzival, who has wedded the maiden
Condwiramur, finds his way back to the Grail Castle&mdash;which
no one can reach except those destined and
chosen to do so by the Grail itself&mdash;breaks the spell,
and rules over the Grail dominions, his son Loherangrain
becoming the Knight of the Swan, who goes abroad
righting wrongs, and who, like all the Grail knights, is
forbidden to reveal his name and origin to the outside
world. Wolfram tells us that he had the substance of
the tale from the Provençal poet Kyot or Guiot&mdash;<q>Kyot,
der meister wol bekannt</q>&mdash;who in his turn&mdash;but
this probably is a mere piece of romantic invention&mdash;professed
to have found it in an Arabic book in
Toledo, written by a heathen named Flegetanis.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Continuators of Chrestien</hi>
</p>

<p>
What exactly may have been the material before
Chrestien de Troyes we cannot tell, but his various
co-workers and continuators, notably Manessier, all
dwell on the Christian character of the objects shown to
Perceval in the castle, and the question arises, How did
they come to acquire this character? The Welsh story,
certainly the most archaic form of the legend, shows
that they did not have it from the beginning. An
<pb n='409' id='page409'/>
indication in one of the French continuations to
Chrestien's <q>Conte</q> may serve to put us on the
track. Gautier, the author of this continuation, tells
us of an attempt on the part of Gauvain [Sir Gawain]
to achieve the adventure of the Grail. He partially
succeeds, and this half-success has the effect of restoring
the lands about the castle, which were desert and
untilled, to blooming fertility. The Grail therefore,
besides its other characters, had a talismanic power in
promoting increase, wealth, and rejuvenation.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Grail a Talisman of Abundance</hi>
</p>

<p>
The character of a cornucopia, a symbol and agent
of abundance and vitality, clings closely to the Grail in
all versions of the legend. Even in the loftiest and
most spiritual of these, the <q>Parzival</q> of Wolfram
von Eschenbach, this quality is very strongly marked.
A sick or wounded man who looked on it could not
die within the week, nor could its servitors grow old:
<q>though one looked on it for two hundred years, his
hair would never turn grey.</q> The Grail knights lived
from it, apparently by its turning into all manner of
food and drink the bread which was presented to it by
pages. Each man had of it food according to his
pleasure, <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>à son gré</foreign>&mdash;from this word <hi rend='italic'>gré, gréable</hi>, the
name Gral, which originated in the French versions,
was supposed to be derived.<note place='foot'><p>
The true derivation is from the Low Latin <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>cratella</foreign>, a small vessel
or chalice.
</p></note> It was the satisfaction
of all desires. In Wolfram's poem the Grail, though
connected with the Eucharist, was, as we have seen, a
stone, not a cup. It thus appears as a relic of ancient
stone-worship. It is remarkable that a similar Stone
of Abundance occurs also in the Welsh <q>Peredur,</q>
though not as one of the mysteries of the castle. It
<pb n='410' id='page410'/>
was guarded by a black serpent, which Peredur slew,
and he gave the stone to his friend Etlyn.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Celtic Cauldron of Abundance</hi>
</p>

<p>
Now the reader has by this time become well
acquainted with an object having the character of a
talisman of abundance and rejuvenation in Celtic myth.
As the Cauldron of the Dagda it came into Ireland
with the Danaans from their mysterious fairy-land. In
Welsh legend Bran the Blessed got it from Ireland,
whither it returned again as part of Branwen's dowry.
In a strange and mystic poem by Taliesin it is represented
as part of the spoils of Hades, or Annwn,
brought thence by Arthur, in a tragic adventure not
otherwise recorded. It is described by Taliesin as
lodged in Caer Pedryvan, the Four-square Castle of
Pwyll; the fire that heated it was fanned by the breath
of nine maidens, its edge was rimmed with pearls,
and it would not cook the food of a coward or man
forsworn:<note place='foot'><p>
A similar selective action is ascribed to the Grail by Wolfram.
It can only be lifted by a pure maiden when carried into the hall,
and a heathen cannot see it or be benefited by it. The same idea
is also strongly marked in the story narrating the early history of
the Grail by Robert de Borron, about 1210: the impure and sinful
cannot benefit by it. Borron, however, does not touch upon the
Perceval or <q>quest</q> portion of the story at all.

Caer Vedwyd means the Castle of Revelry. I follow the version
of this poem given by Squire in his <q>Mythology of the British
Islands,</q> where it may be read in full.
</p></note></l>
</lg>

<p>
More remotely still the cauldron represents the Sun,
which appears in the earliest Aryo-Indian myths as a
golden vessel which pours forth light and heat and
fertility. The lance is the lightning-weapon of the
Thunder God, Indra, appearing in Norse mythology
as the hammer of Thor. The quest for these objects
represents the ideas of the restoration by some divine
champion of the wholesome order of the seasons, disturbed
by some temporary derangement such as those
which to this day bring famine and desolation to India.
</p>

<p>
Now in the Welsh <q>Peredur</q> we have clearly an
outline of the original Celtic tale, but the Grail does
not appear in it. We may conjecture, however, from
Gautier's continuation of Chrestien's poem that a talisman
of abundance figured in early Continental, probably
Breton, versions of the legend. In one version at
least&mdash;that on which Wolfram based his <q>Parzival</q>&mdash;this
talisman was a stone. But usually it would have
been, not a stone, but a cauldron or vessel of some
kind endowed with the usual attributes of the magic
cauldron of Celtic myth. This vessel was associated
with a blood-dripping lance. Here were the suggestive
elements from which some unknown singer, in a flash
of inspiration, transformed the ancient tale of vengeance
and redemption into the mystical romance which at
once took possession of the heart and soul of Christendom.
The magic cauldron became the cup of the
Eucharist, the lance was invested with a more tremendous
guilt than that of the death of Peredur's
<pb n='412' id='page412'/>
kinsman.<note place='foot'><p>
The combination of objects at the Grail Castle is very significant.
They were a sword, a spear, and a vessel, or, in some
versions, a stone. These are the magical treasures brought by the
Danaans into Ireland&mdash;a sword, a spear, a cauldron, and a stone.
See pp. 105, 106.
</p></note> Celtic poetry, German mysticism, Christian
chivalry, and ideas of magic which still cling to the
rude stone monuments of Western Europe&mdash;all these
combined to make the story of the Grail, and to endow
it with the strange attraction which has led to its
re-creation by artist after artist for seven hundred years.
And who, even now, can say that its course is run at
last, and the towers of Montsalvat dissolved into the
mist from which they sprang?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Tale of Taliesin</hi>
</p>

<p>
Alone of the tales in the collection called by Lady
Charlotte Guest the <q>Mabinogion,</q> the story of the
birth and adventures of the mythical bard Taliesin, the
Amergin of Cymric legend, is not found in the fourteenth-century
manuscript entitled <q>The Red Book of
Hergest.</q> It is taken from a manuscript of the late
sixteenth or seventeenth century, and never appears to
have enjoyed much popularity in Wales. Much of the
very obscure poetry attributed to Taliesin is to be found
in it, and this is much older than the prose. The object
of the tale, indeed, as Mr. Nutt has pointed out in his
edition of the <q>Mabinogion,</q> is rather to provide a sort
of framework for stringing together scattered pieces of
verse supposed to be the work of Taliesin than to tell
a connected story about him and his doings.
</p>

<p>
The story of the birth of the hero is the most interesting
thing in the tale. There lived, it was said, <q>in
the time of Arthur of the Round Table,</q><note place='foot'><p>
The Round Table finds no mention in Cymric legend earlier
than the fifteenth century.
</p></note> a man named
<pb n='413' id='page413'/>
Tegid Voel of Penllyn, whose wife was named Ceridwen.
They have a son named Avagddu, who was the most
ill-favoured man in the world. To compensate for his
lack of beauty, his mother resolved to make him a sage.
So, according to the art of the books of Feryllt,<note place='foot'><p>
Vergil, in his medi&aelig;val character of magician.
</p></note> she
had recourse to the great Celtic source of magical
influence&mdash;a cauldron. She began to boil a <q>cauldron
of inspiration and science for her son, that his reception
might be honourable because of his knowledge of the
mysteries of the future state of the world.</q> The
cauldron might not cease to boil for a year and a day,
and only in three drops of it were to be found the
magical grace of the brew.
</p>

<p>
She put Gwion Bach the son of Gwreang of Llanfair
to stir the cauldron, and a blind man named Morda to
keep the fire going, and she made incantations over it
and put in magical herbs from time to time as Feryllt's
book directed. But one day towards the end of the
year three drops of the magic liquor flew out of the
cauldron and lighted on the finger of Gwion. Like
Finn mac Cumhal on a similar occasion, he put his
finger in his mouth, and immediately became gifted
with supernatural insight. He saw that he had got
what was intended for Avagddu, and he saw also that
Ceridwen would destroy him for it if she could. So he
fled to his own land, and the cauldron, deprived of the
sacred drops, now contained nothing but poison, the
power of which burst the vessel, and the liquor ran into
a stream hard by and poisoned the horses of Gwyddno
Garanhir which drank of the water. Whence the stream
is called the Poison of the Horses of Gwyddno from
that time forth.
</p>

<p>
Ceridwen now came on the scene and saw that her
year's labour was lost. In her rage she smote Morda
<pb n='414' id='page414'/>
with a billet of firewood and struck out his eye, and
she then pursued after Gwion Bach. He saw her and
changed himself into a hare. She became a greyhound.
He leaped into a river and became a fish, and she
chased him as an otter. He became a bird and she a
hawk. Then he turned himself into a grain of wheat
and dropped among the other grains on a threshing-floor,
and she became a black hen and swallowed him.
Nine months afterwards she bore him as an infant; and
she would have killed him, but could not on account of
his beauty, <q>so she wrapped him in a leathern bag, and
cast him into the sea to the mercy of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Luck of Elphin</hi>
</p>

<p>
Now Gwyddno, of the poisoned horses, had a salmon
weir on the strand between Dyvi and Aberystwyth.
And his son Elphin, a needy and luckless lad, one day
fished out the leathern bag as it stuck on the weir.
They opened it, and found the infant within. <q>Behold
a radiant brow!</q><note place='foot'><p>
Taliesin.
</p></note> said Gwyddno. <q>Taliesin be he
called,</q> said Elphin. And they brought the child
home very carefully and reared it as their own. And
this was Taliesin, prime bard of the Cymry; and the
first of the poems he made was a lay of praise to Elphin
and promise of good fortune for the future. And
this was fulfilled, for Elphin grew in riches and honour
day after day, and in love and favour with King
Arthur.
</p>

<p>
But one day as men praised King Arthur and all his
belongings above measure, Elphin boasted that he had
a wife as virtuous as any at Arthur's Court and a bard
more skilful than any of the King's; and they flung
him into prison until they should see if he could make
good his boast. And as he lay there with a silver chain
<pb n='415' id='page415'/>
about his feet, a graceless fellow named Rhun was sent
to court the wife of Elphin and to bring back proofs
of her folly; and it was said that neither maid nor
matron with whom Rhun conversed but was evil-spoken
of.
</p>

<p>
Taliesin then bade his mistress conceal herself, and
she gave her raiment and jewels to one of the kitchenmaids,
who received Rhun as if she were mistress of
the household. And after supper Rhun plied the maid
with drink, and she became intoxicated and fell in a
deep sleep; whereupon Rhun cut off one of her
fingers, on which was the signet-ring of Elphin that
he had sent his wife a little while before. Rhun
brought the finger and the ring on it to Arthur's
Court.
</p>

<p>
Next day Elphin was fetched out of prison and
shown the finger and the ring. Whereupon he said:
<q>With thy leave, mighty king, I cannot deny the ring,
but the finger it is on was never my wife's. For this
is the little finger, and the ring fits tightly on it, but
my wife could barely keep it on her thumb. And my
wife, moreover, is wont to pare her nails every Saturday
night, but this nail hath not been pared for a month.
And thirdly, the hand to which this finger belonged
was kneading rye-dough within three days past, but
my wife has never kneaded rye-dough since my wife
she has been.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then the King was angry because his test had failed,
and he ordered Elphin back to prison till he could prove
what he had affirmed about his bard.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Taliesin, Prime Bard of Britain</hi>
</p>

<p>
Then Taliesin went to court, and one high day when
the King's bards and minstrels should sing and play
before him, Taliesin, as they passed him sitting quietly
<pb n='416' id='page416'/>
in a corner, pouted his lips and played <q>Blerwm,
blerwm</q> with his finger on his mouth. And when the
bards came to perform before the King, lo ! a spell was
on them, and they could do nothing but bow before
him and play <q>Blerwm, blerwm</q> with their fingers on
their lips. And the chief of them, Heinin, said:
<q>O king, we be not drunken with wine, but are
dumb through the influence of the spirit that sits in
yon corner under the form of a child.</q> Then Taliesin
was brought forth, and they asked him who he was and
whence he came. And he sang as follows:
</p>

I have somewhat abridged this curious poem. The connexion
with ideas of transmigration, as in the legend of Tuan mac Carell
(see pp. 97-101), is obvious. Tuan's last stage, it may be recalled,
was a fish, and Taliesin was taken in a salmon-weir.
</p></note>
</l>
</lg>

<p>
While Taliesin sang a great storm of wind arose, and
the castle shook with the force of it. Then the King
bade Elphin be brought in before him, and when he
came, at the music of Taliesin's voice and harp the
chains fell open of themselves and he was free. And
many other poems concerning secret things of the past
and future did Taliesin sing before the King and his
lords, and he foretold the coming of the Saxon into
the land, and his oppression of the Cymry, and foretold
also his passing away when the day of his destiny
should come.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Conclusion</hi>
</p>

<p>
Here we end this long survey of the legendary literature
of the Celt. The material is very abundant,
and it is, of course, not practicable in a volume of this
size to do more than trace the main current of the
development of the legendary literature down to the
time when the mythical and legendary element entirely
faded out and free literary invention took its place.
The reader of these pages will, however, it is hoped,
have gained a general conception of the subject which
will enable him to understand the significance of such
tales as we have not been able to touch on here, and to
fit them into their proper places in one or other of the
great cycles of Celtic legend. It will be noticed that
we have not entered upon the vast region of Celtic
<pb n='418' id='page418'/>
folk-lore. Folk-lore has not been regarded as falling
within the scope of the present work. Folk-lore may
sometimes represent degraded mythology, and sometimes
mythology in the making. In either case, it is
its special characteristic that it belongs to and issues
from a class whose daily life lies close to the earth,
toilers in the field and in the forest, who render with
simple directness, in tales or charms, their impressions
of natural or supernatural forces with which their own
lives are environed. Mythology, in the proper sense
of the word, appears only where the intellect and the
imagination have reached a point of development above
that which is ordinarily possible to the peasant mind&mdash;when
men have begun to co-ordinate their scattered
impressions and have felt the impulse to shape them
into poetic creations embodying universal ideas. It is
not, of course, pretended that a hard-and-fast line can
always be drawn between mythology and folk-lore;
still, the distinction seems to me a valid one, and I have
tried to observe it in these pages.
</p>

<p>
After the two historical chapters with which our
study has begun, the object of the book has been literary
rather than scientific. I have, however, endeavoured
to give, as the opportunity arose, such results of recent
critical work on the relics of Celtic myth and legend as
may at least serve to indicate to the reader the nature
of the critical problems connected therewith. I hope
that this may have added somewhat to the value of the
work for students, while not impairing its interest for
the general reader. Furthermore, I may claim that
the book is in this sense scientific, that as far as possible
it avoids any adaptation of its material for the popular
taste. Such adaptation, when done for an avowed
artistic purpose, is of course entirely legitimate; if it
were not, we should have to condemn half the great
<pb n='419' id='page419'/>
poetry of the world. But here the object has been to
present the myths and legends of the Celt as they
actually are. Crudities have not been refined away,
things painful or monstrous have not been suppressed,
except in some few instances, where it has been necessary
to bear in mind that this volume appeals to a
wider audience than that of scientific students alone.
The reader may, I think, rely upon it that he has here
a substantially fair and not over-idealised account of
the Celtic outlook upon life and the world at a time
when the Celt still had a free, independent, natural life,
working out his conceptions in the Celtic tongue, and
taking no more from foreign sources than he could
assimilate and make his own. The legendary literature
thus presented is the oldest non-classical literature of
Europe. This alone is sufficient, I think, to give it a
strong claim on our attention. As to what other claims
it may have, many pages might be filled with quotations
from the discerning praises given to it by critics not of
Celtic nationality, from  Matthew Arnold downwards.
But here let it speak for itself. It will tell us, I believe,
that, as Maeldūn said of one of the marvels he met
with in his voyage into Fairyland: <q>What we see here
was a work of mighty men.</q>

THE PRONUNCIATION OF CELTIC NAMES
</p>

<p>
To render these names accurately without the living voice is impossible.
But with the phonetic renderings given, where required, in the
following index, and with attention to the following general rules,
the reader will get as near to the correct pronunciation as it is at all
necessary for him to do.
</p>

<p rend='text-align: center'>
I. GAELIC
</p>

<p>
Vowels are pronounced as in French or German; thus <hi rend='italic'>i</hi> (long) is
like <hi rend='italic'>ee, e</hi> (long) like <hi rend='italic'>a</hi> in <q>date,</q> <hi rend='italic'>u</hi> (long) like <hi rend='italic'>oo</hi>. A stroke over a
letter signifies length; thus dūn is pronounced <q>doon</q> (not <q>dewn</q>).
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>ch</hi> is a guttural, as in the word <q>loch.</q> It is never pronounced with
a <hi rend='italic'>t</hi> sound, as in English <q>chip.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>c</hi> is always like <hi rend='italic'>k</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>gh</hi> is silent, as in English.
</p>

<p rend='text-align: center'>
II. CYMRIC
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>w</hi>, when a consonant, is pronounced as in English; when a vowel,
like <hi rend='italic'>oc</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>y</hi>, when long, is like <hi rend='italic'>ee</hi>; when short, like <hi rend='italic'>u</hi> in <q>but.</q>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>ch</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>c</hi> as in Gaelic.

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>dd</hi> is like <hi rend='italic'>th</hi> in <q>breathe</q>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>f</hi> is like <hi rend='italic'>v; ff</hi>like English <hi rend='italic'>f</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The sound of <hi rend='italic'>ll</hi> is perhaps better not attempted by the English
